# HEARTBEAT.md (Example)
# Copy this to your Clawdbot workspace (e.g. ~/clawd/HEARTBEAT.md) and customize.

## 🏭 Autonomous Development Cycle

Every heartbeat, run one cycle of the autonomous agent team.

**Follow the full dispatch protocol:**

1. **Read** `~/path/to/your/project/agents/DISPATCH.md` — this is the master protocol, follow it step by step
2. Execute **all 7 phases** in order:
   - Phase 1: Context Load (rotation, roster, rules, memory bank, playbook)
   - Phase 2: Situational Awareness (GitHub state, cross-reference memory)
   - Phase 3: Execute (ONE action as the current role)
   - Phase 4: Memory Update (update bank.md with what happened)
   - Phase 5: Compression Check (archive + compress if triggered)
   - Phase 6: Evolution Check (assess if team needs new/modified roles)
   - Phase 7: State Update (advance rotation, commit & push)

### Critical Rules
- Work from `~/path/to/your/project/`
- Branch from `develop` for all work, PR back to `develop`
- Use `gh` CLI for all GitHub operations
- Every commit MUST follow conventional commits
- **READ the memory bank before acting**
- **UPDATE the memory bank after acting**
- Engineering role writes REAL code with tests
- Ops role adds REAL rules and CI improvements
- Keep actions meaningful — no placeholder content
