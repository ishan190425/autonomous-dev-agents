### 1. Sprint Planning

Create a sprint milestone and assign open issues:

- Review backlog
- Group related issues
- Set sprint goals
- Add milestone labels

### 2. Progress Update

Comment on in-progress issues/PRs with status checks:

- Is this blocked?
- Does it need review?
- Can we break it down further?

### 3. Retrospective

Create a retro document in `docs/`:

- What went well
- What could improve
- Action items

### 4. Create Coordination Issues
