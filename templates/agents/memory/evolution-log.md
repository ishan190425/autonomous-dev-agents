| 🎨 Design      | [Name] | API and interface design                     |

**Rationale:** These six roles cover the full product development lifecycle: research → design → product → engineering → ops → scrum. Each has distinct, non-overlapping responsibilities.

## Evolution Signals to Watch

- [ ] When a new domain/module grows large → Consider a **specialist** role
- [ ] When external integrations multiply → Consider a **DevRel / Integration** role
- [ ] When testing becomes complex → Consider a **QA Engineer** role
- [ ] When ML models need training → Consider a **ML Engineer** role
- [ ] When docs outgrow the team → Consider a **Technical Writer** role
