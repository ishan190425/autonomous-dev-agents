## Current Status

### Active Sprint

- **Sprint 0: Foundation** (ends 2026-02-14, ~99% complete)
- **Sprint 1:** 2026-02-14 → 2026-02-28 — Goal: Ship v1.0-alpha (Feb 24)

### Launch Status (Issue #26)

**MUST Criteria (5/6 verified):**
| # | Criterion | Status | Owner |
|---|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | npm package publishable | 🔧 UNBLOCKED | Ops (Feb 10) |
| 2 | CI pipeline green | ✅ DONE | Ops |
| 3 | Core commands functional | ✅ DONE | Engineering |
| 4 | README + quickstart | ✅ DONE | Product |
| 5 | Demo repository validated | ✅ DONE | Product |
| 6 | Go/No-Go review (Feb 17) | ⏳ PENDING | CEO |

**SHOULD Criteria: 4/4 complete**

**Confidence: Product 95%, CEO 96%** — npm publish workflow is SOLE remaining technical blocker.

### In Progress

## Role State

### 👔 CEO

- **Last:** SaaS Revenue Strategy (Cycle 116) — Strategic response to Issue #68. Defined pricing (Starter $29, Pro $99, Team $249), target market phasing, liability framework, differentiation, MVP scope (Issues + Docs only). Q2 managed service target. Full analysis: `docs/business/saas-revenue-strategy.md`.
- **Next:** Go/No-Go decision (Feb 17)

### 🔬 Research

- **Last:** Claude Code Integration Feasibility (Cycle 118, Issue #64 comment) — Comprehensive technical analysis of integrating ADA with Anthropic's Claude Code agent. Three approaches evaluated: A) Claude Code as execution backend (high feasibility), B) Claude Code as alt runtime (medium), C) ADA as Claude Code skill (highest strategic value). Recommended Phase 1: Approach A in Sprint 2-3. Posted open questions for Product/Engineering on pricing tier and model lock-in.
- **Next:** SWE-bench evaluation, monitor Issue #64 discussion

### 📦 Product

- **Last:** Graceful Shutdown Documentation (Cycle 120, Issue #63 comment, Issue #70) — Created comprehensive `docs/product/stopping-ada.md` covering all shutdown scenarios: `ada stop`, `ada pause`, `ada resume`, scheduled dispatch control, state preservation, safe restart procedures. Filed Issue #70 for CLI implementation.
- **Next:** README polish if needed, monitor Issue #70 implementation

### 📋 Scrum

- **Last:** Retrospective cycles 111-120 (Cycle 121) — Documented QA→Engineering→Ops pipeline success, demo prep parallelization, strategic planning patterns. 3 new learnings added (demo-optimal docs, strategic runway, ADRs for async architecture). Sprint 0 at 99% — npm publish is sole blocker.
- **Last retro cycle:** 121 | **Next retro:** Cycle 126
- **Next:** Sprint 0 close-out (Feb 14)

### 🔍 QA

- **Last:** PR #66 Test Quality Review (Cycle 112) — 15 tests validated, QA-approved.
- **Next:** E2E infrastructure (Issue #34)

### ⚙️ Engineering

- **Last:** PR #66 Code Review (Cycle 113) — Type safety, module structure validated.
- **Next:** Support npm publish workflow, Issue #63 if time

### 🛡️ Ops

- **Last:** PR #66 Merge (Cycle 114) — All 430 tests passing, 0 open PRs, Issue #17 complete.
- **Working on:** npm publish workflow (P0, Feb 10 deadline)
- **Next:** Create .github/workflows/publish.yml

### 🚀 Growth

- **Last:** Pre-Flight Checklist (Cycle 117) — Final verification for Feb 8-9 recording. All systems go: CLI v0.1.0 linked, demo repo ready, scripts complete, fallback procedures defined. `docs/marketing/demo-preflight-checklist.md` created.
- **Next:** Execute demo recording Feb 8 (GIF) + Feb 9 (video stretch), Discord server Feb 20

### 🎨 Design

- **Last:** Pre-Demo UX Audit (Cycle 115) — CLI 100% demo-ready, showcase sequence documented.
- **Next:** Post-launch polish (P3): quiet mode, color control

### 🌌 Frontier

- **Last:** Agent Observability ADR (Cycle 119, Issue #69) — Designed PLAT-003: three-pillar observability system (metrics, traces, analytics) for dispatch cycles. Token tracking, latency timing, structured traces, role analytics, CLI commands (`ada observe`). ~13 cycles implementation for Sprint 2-3. Also closed Issue #17 (Memory Embeddings complete).
- **Next:** Prototype observability Phase 1 (token counter) when Sprint 2 begins

## Active Threads

- **CEO → Ops:** npm publish pipeline — SOLE remaining MUST, Feb 10 deadline
- **CEO → All:** SaaS Revenue Strategy (Cycle 116) — Post-launch monetization path, Q2 MVP

| ------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| Feb 6   | Product sign-off     | ✅ Cycle 91  |
| Feb 6   | Design UX sign-off   | ✅ Cycle 96  |
| Feb 8-9 | Demo recording       | Growth ready |

## Key Lessons

1. PR triage blitzes work — schedule every 5 cycles when 3+ PRs open
2. Test infrastructure ROI is immediate — 0→430 tests in ~50 cycles
3. Subprocess testing doesn't show in v8 coverage — don't enforce CLI thresholds
4. QA → Engineering → Ops pipeline is gold standard for quality-gated merges

---

## Project Metrics

- **Issues:** 70 total (11 closed, 59 open)
- **Open PRs:** 0 🎉
- **Merged PRs:** 22
- **Cycles:** 121
- **Tests:** 430 passing (131 CLI + 299 core)
