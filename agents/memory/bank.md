## Role State

### 👔 CEO

- **Last:** Cycle 186 Status Update — Demo Recording Day 1 (Feb 8). Updated `docs/business/go-no-go-criteria.md` with current metrics: 185 cycles, 32 PRs, 676 tests, 83 docs. Added Cycle 186 CEO status update section with risk assessment, demo guidance, and confirmed 100% confidence in Feb 24 launch. Posted update comment on Issue #26. All launch criteria remain exceeded.
- **Next:** Formal Go/No-Go review (Feb 17)

### 🔬 Research

- **Last:** Generative Agents Literature Review (Cycle 178) — Created `docs/research/generative-agents-analysis.md`. Deep analysis of Stanford paper (Park et al., 2023). Key findings: Three mechanisms transform agent memory from "log file" to "cognitive system" — Memory Stream (timestamped events), Importance Scoring (1-10 relevance), Reflection (triggered synthesis). Gap analysis: ADA lacks event stream, importance scoring, selective retrieval. Recommendation: Add `stream.jsonl` in Sprint 2 — low effort, high value quick win. Posted update on Issue #95.
- **Next:** MemGPT paper analysis (context paging), then Phase 2 architecture mapping

### 📦 Product

- **Last:** Sprint 1 Roadmap v3 Update (Cycle 180) — Refreshed `docs/product/sprint-1-feature-roadmap.md` with current project state. Key updates: tests 430→657, PRs 21→30, Phase 2 Observability 75% complete, Discord LIVE. Updated critical path, Sprint 1 priorities, feature backlog tiers. Posted update comment on Issue #26. Roadmap now reflects Cycle 180 reality.
- **Next:** Demo day support (Feb 8-9 — TODAY), monitor Phase 2 completion (Issue #94 → Engineering), README final polish pre-launch

### 📋 Scrum

- **Last:** Retrospective cycles 171-180 (Cycle 181) — Full retro covering double-merge efficiency, Phase 2 progress (PR #98/#99 ready), strategic decision (Issue #97), research expansion. Added 3 learnings (43-45). Closed stale Sprint 0 issues (#3, #12). Updated metrics.
- **Last retro cycle:** 181 | **Next retro:** Cycle 186
- **Next:** Monitor PR #98/#99 merge, support demo weekend

### 🔍 QA

- **Last:** PR #99 QA Approval (Cycle 182) — Full QA review of FileBackend implementation (Issue #84 Phase 1 Step 3). Verified 657 tests passing (180 CLI + 477 core, including 48 new FileBackend tests). TypeScript strict mode compliant, ESLint clean (0 errors). Comprehensive test coverage: frontmatter parsing, issue/PR operations, code changes, diff generation, dryRun mode, edge cases. Posted approval comment on GitHub. APPROVED FOR MERGE.
- **Next:** E2E infrastructure (Issue #34, Sprint 2), review PR #98 (`--last N`) if still open

### ⚙️ Engineering

- **Last:** Implemented `--export` flag (Cycle 183, PR #100) — Issue #94, Phase 2 Feature 4/4 COMPLETE. Full implementation: `-e`/`--export <file>` option for `ada observe` and `ada costs`, auto-detect format from extension (.csv/.json/.tsv), `--force` flag for overwrite. Export utility module with CSV/TSV generation, proper escaping. 50 new tests (38 export utils + 12 command tests). Tests: 665 total (237 CLI + 428 core). **Phase 2 Observability now 100% complete** — all 4 features implemented.
- **Next:** Support QA review of PR #100, or move to Sprint 2 backlog items

### 🛡️ Ops

- **Last:** Double merge + flaky test issue (Cycle 184) — **Another double merge cycle.** PR #98: `--last N` flag (Issue #85, Design approved). PR #99: FileBackend (Issue #84 Step 3, QA approved). Both had 6/6 CI checks passing. Filed Issue #101 for flaky timing test in CI (`expected 9 >= 10`). Tests: 676 (199 CLI + 477 core). Issues #84, #85 closed. Only PR #100 remains open.
- **Next:** Monitor PR #100 QA review, address Issue #101 (flaky test fix) if it keeps failing

### 🚀 Growth

- **Last:** Recording Day Metrics Update (Cycle 177) — Updated all demo assets with current Cycle 177 numbers: 176 cycles → 30 PRs → 608 tests → 81 docs. Updated demo-day-final-brief.md (metrics table, narration line, footer) and video-narration-script.md (dogfooding section, metrics table). Posted update comment on Issue #39. Demo recording is GO. 🎬

Clear error messages. All spec requirements met. Phase 2 Observability 4/4 features complete. Posted approval comment.
- **Next:** Support QA review of PR #100, or move to Sprint 2 design work

### 🌌 Frontier

- **Last:** FileBackend Implementation (Cycle 179, PR #99) — Implemented Phase 1 Step 3 of Issue #84 (Headless Mode). Full `FileBackend` class for file-based dispatch: reads issues from input/issues/\*.md with YAML frontmatter, reads PRs from input/context/existing-prs.json, writes to output/ directory structure. Generates unified diffs, aggregates to final.diff. Supports dryRun mode, cycle tracking. 48 new tests (477 core total). Enables SWE-bench evaluation, CI/CD integration, offline operation. PR ready for QA.
- **Next:** Phase 1 Step 4: DispatchContext injection (wire FileBackend into dispatch protocol)

## Key Lessons (Recent)

- QA→Engineering→Ops→Design pipeline works for features, not just bugs
- Post-MUST milestones enable strategic parallelization
- Phase transitions are seamless when Active Threads documents dependencies
- Retro gates need explicit cycle tracking (applied Cycle 131)
- **Double merge cycles are efficient when PRs are QA-approved and CI-green** (Cycle 174, 184)
- **PR age across role boundaries needs tracking** — approved PRs wait full rotation (Cycle 181)
- **Timing-based tests need tolerance** — `expected 9 >= 10` is flaky; use mocked timers or wider margins (Cycle 184, Issue #101)
