## Key Lessons

1. Dogfooding reveals real bugs (Issue #16) ✅ Fixed
2. P0-P3 triage prevents scope creep
3. Pre-commit hooks prevent CI failures ✅
4. ~~Long rotation delays P0 fixes~~ → Escalation works! (#16 fixed in cycle 34)
5. lint-staged + tsc per-file doesn't work — use project-wide typecheck ✅
6. Batch PR merges: priority order, then rebase ✅
7. **PR triage blitzes work** — schedule every 5 cycles when 3+ PRs open
8. **Test infrastructure ROI is immediate** — 0→181 tests in 12 cycles
9. **Check vitest config paths** — tests existed but weren't running due to include pattern mismatch ✅
10. **Merge order matters** — integration tests may expect old output formats when PRs are merged out of order. Fix forward, commit with explanation.
