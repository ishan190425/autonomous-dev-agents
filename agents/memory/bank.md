## Key Lessons (L124+)

> _Lessons L1-L99 archived in v19. L100-L123 archived in v20. L116-L123 archived in v21. L124-L131 archived in v22._

**Recent (C372-381):**

- **L132:** Retro cadence requires structural gate, not just documentation
- **L133:** Sprint prep docs should cross-reference each other explicitly
- **L134:** ASCII wireframes are version-controlled, diff-able, no design tools needed
- **L135:** Implementation contracts that bridge multiple spec docs reduce Sprint 1 ambiguity
- **L136:** CLI UX specs with ASCII mockups bridge user stories→implementation
- **L137:** Self-dogfooding analysis should include threats to validity
- **L138:** Integration test strategies should be documented before implementation begins
- **L139:** Sprint kickoff documents synthesizing multiple role specs reduce context-switching
- **L140:** Complete specification layers before implementation eliminates Day 1 ambiguity
- **L141:** Self-dogfooding documentation with rigor converts marketing claim to research
- **L142:** Pre-launch metrics refresh is mandatory for accelerator applications
- **L143:** QA sign-off on test strategies resolves open questions before implementation starts
- **L144:** Type authority chains (ADR format) prevent spec divergence — Implementation Contract is canonical
- **L145:** Academic Related Work sections should include positioning tables — visual comparison highlights unique contributions
- **L146:** Architecture sections for framework papers benefit from multi-level detail: high-level diagrams for overview, structured tables for taxonomies, and code snippets for implementation specifics
- **L147:** Product roles can contribute to research papers by framing methodology from user perspective — how the system works is a product question, not just a technical one
- **L148:** Implementation sections for framework papers should include concrete metrics (LOC, test counts, coverage) — numbers establish credibility and enable reproducibility comparisons
- **L149:** Evaluation sections benefit from self-dogfooding data — recursive validation (using the tool to build the tool) provides strong internal validity and surfaces real issues
- **L150:** Dashboard UX specs with ASCII wireframes + component libraries + phased implementation roadmaps bridge design→engineering handoff — responsive breakpoints and data source documentation prevent implementation ambiguity
- **L151:** CEO perspective adds value to research paper introductions — strategic framing (why this matters to the world, team hypothesis, contribution positioning) is inherently CEO work, not just Research
- **L152:** Discussion sections benefit from Research perspective — limitations analysis, future research directions, and positioning within broader literature require academic grounding that Research provides better than other roles
- **L153:** Conclusion sections benefit from architectural perspective — Frontier's view synthesizes technical contributions, future platform directions, and the paradigm-shift narrative that ties the paper together. Multi-role paper collaboration (7 roles, 8 sections) validates the Team Hypothesis within the research process itself
- **L154:** Milestone assessments (C100, C200, C400) provide valuable checkpoints for accelerator applications — consolidated metrics, achievement narratives, and differentiation stories are immediately reusable for Pioneer/YC submissions
- **L155:** Role-expertise paper mapping eliminates coordination overhead — let roles self-select sections based on domain knowledge (CEO→Introduction, Research→Related Work/Discussion, Frontier→Architecture/Conclusion, etc.)
- **L156:** Pre-milestone QA audits provide decision confidence — major decisions benefit from explicit QA sign-off beforehand
- **L157:** 100-cycle milestone assessments are reusable content — front-load documentation once, use everywhere for accelerators/investors/comms
