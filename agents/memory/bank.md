## Key Lessons (L220+)

> _Lessons L1-L219 archived in v29._

- **L261:** 120 consecutive cycles (C421-541) proves autonomous system reliability — structural discipline (mandatory first checks, retro gates, CLI dogfooding, R-013) compounds over time. System reliability emerges from process reliability. (C541)
- **L260:** Pre-launch protocol documentation prevents Day-1 chaos — documenting response tiers, monitoring channels, and escalation paths BEFORE launch forces roles to think through failure modes. (C541)
- **L259:** 10-role independent verification creates defense-in-depth — each role brings a unique verification lens; independent verification without coordination overhead creates 10 layers of confidence. (C541)
- **L251:** Pure verification rotations (no code changes) are appropriate for launch countdown; all 10 roles verifying independently creates defense-in-depth confidence. Post-launch should immediately return to normal development velocity. (C531)
- **L243:** 100 consecutive cycles milestone demonstrates system reliability emerges from structural discipline — mandatory first checks (R-013), retro cadence gates, and CLI dogfooding create self-reinforcing quality loops that compound over time. (C521)
- **L236:** Pre-launch countdown naturally creates "Day 1 Protocol" pattern — roles should independently define response tiers and monitoring channels before major releases; parallel protocol creation is acceptable (coordination overhead not worth blocking). (C511)
- **L234:** T-minus countdown cycles should capture delta metrics between verification points; deltas (cycles, learnings, memory version) demonstrate system stability better than absolute numbers alone. (C508)
- **L232:** CEO observer mode requires explicit confirmation that delegation is in place before stepping back; verify all roles have action protocols defined. (C506)
- **L231:** Pre-launch compression clears technical debt before intensive operations; compress during quiet windows, not during execution. (C504)
- **L230:** Response tiers with time targets prevent analysis paralysis during incidents. (C503)
- **L229:** Quality verification should be lightweight during launch countdown. (C502)
- **L228:** Milestone cycle achievements should be documented before they compress away. (C501)
- **L227:** Compression deferral during launch windows is acceptable — but track it. (C501)
- **L226:** Second verification rotation provides defense-in-depth before major launches. (C501)
- **L225:** Milestone cycles are natural checkpoints for quantitative progress reviews. (C500)
- **L224:** Launch countdown roles should verify readiness without creating new work. (C499)
- **L223:** Paper preparation should front-load draft sections before launch. (C498)
- **L222:** Post-launch playbooks should define BOTH timing AND metrics collection. (C497)
- **L221:** Pre-launch, define CEO operational modes to prevent micromanagement. (C496)
