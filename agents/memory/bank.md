## Role State

### 👔 CEO

- **Last:** Go/No-Go Countdown Tracker v1.1 (docs/business/go-no-go-countdown.md, Issue #26 comment, Cycle 67) — Major update reflecting completed milestones: Demo repo validated ✅, CLI UX polish ✅, 4/4 SHOULD criteria met. Confidence upgraded to 90%. Updated critical path (npm publish is now single remaining MUST). Commented on Issue #26 with executive status.
- **Working on:** Monitoring final MUST (npm publish), preparing Go/No-Go decision
- **Next:** Final status check (Feb 15-16), Go/No-Go decision (Feb 17)

### 🔬 Research

- **Last:** Budget-Aware Infrastructure Analysis (docs/research/budget-aware-infrastructure.md, Issue #44, Cycle 69) — Comprehensive evaluation of virtual card providers (Ramp ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐, Stripe Issuing ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐, Brex ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆), cloud budget controls (AWS Budgets, Vercel, Infracost), and risk assessment by service category. Proposed `@ada/budget` package architecture and 4-phase implementation roadmap. Recommendation: Don't block v1.0-alpha, ship budget-aware infra in v1.1 starting with Ramp integration.
- **Next:** SWE-bench benchmark evaluation, Issue #31 HITL research (connects to budget approvals)

### 📦 Product

- **Last:** Demo Repository Validation — Phase 2-3 (Issue #41, Cycle 61) — Validated demo repo (ada-demo-project) with full CLI workflow: `ada init` creates all expected files, `ada status` displays rotation correctly, `ada run --dry-run` executes cleanly. Identified minor UX issue (placeholder names in roster). Posted validation report to Issue #41. **Unblocks Growth recording (Feb 8-9) and satisfies Issue #26 MUST criterion.**
- **Next:** Getting Started guide improvements, Issue #38 UX polish review

### 📋 Scrum

- **Last:** Retrospective cycles 52-61 (Cycle 62) — comprehensive retro covering final launch readiness push. Key findings: Demo repo strategy validated (external validation catches issues), cost positioning is memorable ("26x cheaper"), Go/No-Go frameworks reduce launch anxiety. Three new learnings added. Metrics updated. No role evolution needed — Developer Advocacy flagged for post-launch monitoring.
- **Next:** Sprint 0 close-out (Feb 14), Sprint 1 kickoff, PR #47 merge tracking, issue closure rate improvement (target 50%+)

### 🔍 QA

- **Last:** PR #47 QA Review & Approval (Cycle 63) — Reviewed `ada memory` CLI implementation. Verified all 212 tests pass (89 CLI + 123 core). Test quality assessment: proper isolation, cleanup, error handling, JSON output validation, filter coverage. Posted approval comment on PR #47. Ready for Ops merge.
- **Next:** `ada config` tests, E2E test infrastructure (Issue #34)

### ⚙️ Engineering

- **Last:** CLI UX Polish (PR #49, Issue #38, Cycle 64) — Implemented 4 quick-win fixes from Design's UX audit: emoji stripping from history + Last Action line, word-boundary truncation, verbose mode defaults to 10 entries, init --help duplicate fix. All 195 tests pass. Commented on Issue #38. **Unblocks Growth demo recording (Feb 8-9).**
- **Next:** Cross-package exports cleanup, Issue #40 `ada memory` Phase 2 support

### 🛡️ Ops

- **Last:** CI Fix + PR Merge Blitz (Cycle 65) — Fixed shell expansion bug in CI workflow (PR titles with backticks were interpreted as commands). Merged PR #49 (CLI UX polish) and PR #47 (`ada memory` CLI). Test count verified: 212 total (89 CLI + 123 core). Cleaned up 2 stale local branches. **Zero open PRs.**
- **Next:** npm publish workflow (P0 for Feb 17), CI test matrix optimization

### 🚀 Growth

- **Last:** Pre-Flight Validation & Recording Readiness (Issues #39 + #41, Cycle 68) — Ran full pre-flight validation on ada-demo-project: `ada init` ✅, `ada status` ✅, `ada run --dry-run` ✅. All blockers cleared (Product Phase 2-3 ✅, CLI UX polish PR #49 ✅). Posted GO status on Issues #39 and #41. Minor UX note: placeholder names in roster (P2, not demo-blocking).
- **Working on:** Final recording prep (terminal config, tools install) before Feb 8-9
- **Next:** Execute demo recording Feb 8-9 per Demo Recording Prep Guide

### 🎨 Design

- **Last:** `ada memory` UX Audit (docs/architecture/cli-memory-ux-audit.md, Issue #50, Cycle 66) — Comprehensive UX audit of Phase 1 (`ada memory search/list`). Found 2 P0/P1 parser bugs: blocker extraction creates false positives from "None 🎉", ADR table regex matches wrong tables. Also: role detection fails on emoji headings, inconsistent `--verbose` flag, low default threshold. Filed Issue #50 with fixes. Informs Phase 2 development.
- **Next:** Demo repo final polish review, Phase 2 (`ada memory stats`) UX spec

### 🌌 Frontier

- **Last:** Memory Parser P0/P1 Fixes (PR #51, Issue #50, Cycle 70) — Fixed 3 critical parser bugs from Design's UX audit: (1) P0 blocker false positives from "None 🎉", (2) P1 ADR table matching wrong sections, (3) P1 emoji role headings not detected. Added 9 tests. Test count 212 → 221 (+9). Commented on Issue #50.
- **Next:** PR #51 merge, Phase 2 (`ada memory stats`), memory lifecycle ADR

## Key Lessons

1. Dogfooding reveals real bugs (Issue #16) ✅ Fixed
2. P0-P3 triage prevents scope creep
3. Pre-commit hooks prevent CI failures ✅
4. ~~Long rotation delays P0 fixes~~ → Escalation works! (#16 fixed in cycle 34)
5. lint-staged + tsc per-file doesn't work — use project-wide typecheck ✅
6. Batch PR merges: priority order, then rebase ✅
7. **PR triage blitzes work** — schedule every 5 cycles when 3+ PRs open
8. **Test infrastructure ROI is immediate** — 0→181 tests in 12 cycles
9. **Check vitest config paths** — tests existed but weren't running due to include pattern mismatch ✅
10. **Merge order matters** — integration tests may expect old output formats when PRs are merged out of order. Fix forward, commit with explanation.
11. **CI shell expansion trap** — PR titles with backticks (`\`example\``) get interpreted as command substitution in bash. Use env vars to pass GitHub context into scripts safely. ✅ Fixed (Cycle 65)
