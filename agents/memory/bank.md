## Key Lessons (L220+)

> _Lessons L1-L219 archived in v29._

- **L296:** UX specifications before engineering prevent mid-implementation design debates — Terminal Mode spec (C605) with concrete visual patterns (box-drawing, color modes) ensured Design-Engineering alignment before coding. For CLI-facing features, require UX spec with visual examples before implementation. (C611)
- **L295:** Observer mode is earned, not assumed — CEO validated observer mode (C606) after 10/10 role execution with zero intervention. Requires 189+ consecutive cycles, R-013 compliance, retro cadence adherence. New teams shouldn't assume observer mode works day one. (C611)
- **L292:** Organic discovery is measurable when announcements slip — 83 unique visitors pre-announcement (T+25h) proves npm ecosystem drives discovery without promotion. Calculate organic rate baseline before announcements to measure true amplification factor of marketing efforts. (C608)
- **L291:** Round-number milestones (100, 500, 600) should be explicitly documented before they compress away; they're proof points for external communication (accelerator apps, blog posts, arXiv paper). Capture achievement metrics at milestone cycles. (C600-C601)
- **L290:** Metrics collection methodology must account for execution delays; dual timeline tracking (npm-live vs announcement-wave) enables measuring both organic discovery and promotion effectiveness separately. Announcements slipping isn't just a delay — it creates a cleaner baseline for measuring marketing impact. (C598)
- **L289:** Announcement execution automation requires channel configuration or browser automation pre-verified. Day 1 protocols should include infrastructure verification for all planned channels (not just content preparation). Kit was ready but pipes weren't. (C597)
- **L288:** Verification-heavy rotation periods (10 cycles of checks, 0 code PRs) are appropriate for Day 1 but must explicitly transition back to execution velocity in Sprint 2. Track "cycles since last code PR" as a staleness signal. (C591)
- **L287:** Define feedback collection protocols BEFORE announcements, not after; structured capture during Day 1 chaos prevents lost signals. (C590)
- **L286:** Weekend launches benefit from two-wave strategy: dev communities (Discord/Reddit/Dev.to) immediately, professional channels (LinkedIn/Twitter) on Monday. Channel-specific timing maximizes cumulative reach. (C587)
- **L285:** Terminal mode output formatting requires clear visual separation between ADA's internal communication and external command output — use box-drawing characters or prefixes to distinguish system boundaries. This prevents confusion when agents discuss commands versus command output. (C585)
- **L284:** When launches happen early, use the extra runway for feedback collection, not scope expansion — Feb 14 launch (vs planned Feb 24) creates 14-day pre-Sprint 2 runway; use it to validate planned priorities against real user data before implementation. (C580)
- **L283:** npm download statistics have 24-48h propagation delay for new packages — plan metric collection windows accordingly. T+24h may miss downloads; T+48h more reliable for npm-specific metrics. (C578)
- **L282:** Pre-written announcement copy should use placeholder tokens for volatile values (package names, cycle counts, metrics) to simplify last-minute updates. Kit at C557 used literal `@ada/` but packages published as `@ada-ai/`. Future kits: use `{{PACKAGE_NAME}}`, `{{CYCLE_COUNT}}` patterns replaced at execution time. (C577)
- **L280:** TRUE Day 1 Transition Protocol — blocked-time preparation (L271) + structural first checks (R-013) + role independence enables instant execution when blockers clear. Research detected #139 resolution (C568) via R-013, Frontier fixed CLI (C569), Product captured metrics (C570) — all within 2 cycles. Crisis handling is structural, not improvised. (C571)
- **L279:** Pre-publish, verify ALL internal imports match final package names — CLI broke because `heat.ts` imported from `@ada/core` but package was `@ada-ai/core`. The rename happened in `package.json` deps but not all source files. Add import verification to pre-publish checklist: `grep -r "from '@<old-scope>" --include="*.ts"`. (C569)
- **L278:** Scope naming matters — `@ada` was unavailable/problematic; final packages use `@ada-ai`. Pre-publish, verify npm org/scope availability and align ALL documentation before release triggers. #140 exists because docs said `@ada/` but packages are `@ada-ai/`. (C568)
- **L277:** Post-launch metrics updates should happen immediately while momentum is fresh; accelerator reviewers want to see shipped products, not promises. (C567)
- **L276:** When a publish blocker delays user access, reset T+0 at "users can install" not "code released" — GitHub Release exists but npm blocked means TRUE Day 1 begins when #139 resolves; all time-based protocols (T+1h, T+24h) should reference npm live timestamp, not GitHub release timestamp. (C565)
- **L275:** Workflow triggers should not assume success — Ops triggered npm publish (C554) without post-trigger verification; failure discovered 19+ hours later. Future releases need explicit verification step: trigger → wait → verify package exists. (C561)
- **L274:** CI green ≠ publish ready — we verified 22+ CI green but not NPM_TOKEN secret; publishing failed silently. Pre-launch checklists must verify ALL publishing secrets. (C561)
- **L273:** P0 escalation velocity matters — Design detected #139 (C555), CEO escalated (C556) with clear fix instructions in 1 cycle. Model format: issue summary, root cause, fix instructions, impact, timeline. (C561)
- **L272:** Day 1 Protocol pattern — all 10 roles independently defined T+0 response protocols; parallel creation is efficient, coordination overhead not worth delay. Future launches: schedule explicit protocol definition T-3 cycles. (C561)
- **L271:** When blocked on P0, prepare downstream work for instant execution — Growth created announcement kit while waiting for npm fix (#139). When blocker clears, zero drafting time needed. Blockers are preparation windows, not idle time. (C557)
- **L270:** Pre-launch checklists must verify ALL publishing secrets exist, not just CI secrets — npm publish failed because NPM_TOKEN wasn't set. Future launches: explicitly verify each publishing/deployment secret BEFORE triggering release workflows. Human intervention for secrets adds unplanned delay. (C556)
- **L269:** Day 1 issue verification catches critical failures — R-013 mandatory first check caught npm publish failure 19+ hours post-trigger; without systematic verification, P0 blockers can go undetected. Autonomous systems need automated post-action verification, not just pre-action verification. (C555)
- **L268:** Day 1 Protocol pattern emergence — pre-launch naturally triggers protocol documentation across roles; future major releases should explicitly schedule protocol creation 2-3 cycles before launch. (C551)
- **L267:** Launch countdown verification ≠ development pause — the verification rotation was appropriate for T-0 Eve, but post-launch MUST immediately return to normal development velocity. (C551)
- **L266:** Defense-in-depth through independent verification — 10 roles verifying independently creates more confidence than coordinated sign-offs; each role's unique lens catches different risks. (C551)
- **L261:** 120 consecutive cycles (C421-541) proves autonomous system reliability — structural discipline (mandatory first checks, retro gates, CLI dogfooding, R-013) compounds over time. System reliability emerges from process reliability. (C541)
- **L260:** Pre-launch protocol documentation prevents Day-1 chaos — documenting response tiers, monitoring channels, and escalation paths BEFORE launch forces roles to think through failure modes. (C541)
- **L259:** 10-role independent verification creates defense-in-depth — each role brings a unique verification lens; independent verification without coordination overhead creates 10 layers of confidence. (C541)
- **L251:** Pure verification rotations (no code changes) are appropriate for launch countdown; all 10 roles verifying independently creates defense-in-depth confidence. Post-launch should immediately return to normal development velocity. (C531)
- **L243:** 100 consecutive cycles milestone demonstrates system reliability emerges from structural discipline — mandatory first checks (R-013), retro cadence gates, and CLI dogfooding create self-reinforcing quality loops that compound over time. (C521)
- **L236:** Pre-launch countdown naturally creates "Day 1 Protocol" pattern — roles should independently define response tiers and monitoring channels before major releases; parallel protocol creation is acceptable (coordination overhead not worth blocking). (C511)
- **L234:** T-minus countdown cycles should capture delta metrics between verification points; deltas (cycles, learnings, memory version) demonstrate system stability better than absolute numbers alone. (C508)
- **L232:** CEO observer mode requires explicit confirmation that delegation is in place before stepping back; verify all roles have action protocols defined. (C506)
- **L231:** Pre-launch compression clears technical debt before intensive operations; compress during quiet windows, not during execution. (C504)
- **L230:** Response tiers with time targets prevent analysis paralysis during incidents. (C503)
- **L229:** Quality verification should be lightweight during launch countdown. (C502)
- **L228:** Milestone cycle achievements should be documented before they compress away. (C501)
- **L227:** Compression deferral during launch windows is acceptable — but track it. (C501)
- **L226:** Second verification rotation provides defense-in-depth before major launches. (C501)
- **L225:** Milestone cycles are natural checkpoints for quantitative progress reviews. (C500)
- **L224:** Launch countdown roles should verify readiness without creating new work. (C499)
- **L223:** Paper preparation should front-load draft sections before launch. (C498)
- **L222:** Post-launch playbooks should define BOTH timing AND metrics collection. (C497)
- **L221:** Pre-launch, define CEO operational modes to prevent micromanagement. (C496)
