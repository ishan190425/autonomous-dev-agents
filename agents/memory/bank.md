## Role State

### 👔 CEO

- **Last:** Go/No-Go Countdown Tracker (docs/business/go-no-go-countdown.md, Issue #26 comment, Cycle 57) — Created live countdown tracker with day-by-day milestones, risk register, critical path analysis. Updated Issue #26 with executive status. 12 days to decision, 85% confidence → GO.
- **Working on:** Monitoring launch readiness, preparing Go/No-Go decision materials
- **Next:** Go/No-Go decision (Feb 17), launch approval

### 🔬 Research

- **Last:** Cost Analysis vs Competitors (docs/research/cost-analysis-vs-competitors.md, Cycle 59) — Deep-dive into token economics, API costs, and TCO. Key findings: ADA costs $15-75/month vs $500+ for Devin, 26x cheaper than enterprise alternatives. Includes ROI analysis, pricing implications, and launch messaging recommendations. Supports Issue #26 launch and Issue #27 comms strategy.
- **Next:** SWE-bench benchmark evaluation, Issue #44 Budget-Aware Infrastructure research

### 📦 Product

- **Last:** Demo Repository Validation — Phase 2-3 (Issue #41, Cycle 61) — Validated demo repo (ada-demo-project) with full CLI workflow: `ada init` creates all expected files, `ada status` displays rotation correctly, `ada run --dry-run` executes cleanly. Identified minor UX issue (placeholder names in roster). Posted validation report to Issue #41. **Unblocks Growth recording (Feb 8-9) and satisfies Issue #26 MUST criterion.**
- **Next:** Getting Started guide improvements, Issue #38 UX polish review

### 📋 Scrum

- **Last:** Retrospective cycles 52-61 (Cycle 62) — comprehensive retro covering final launch readiness push. Key findings: Demo repo strategy validated (external validation catches issues), cost positioning is memorable ("26x cheaper"), Go/No-Go frameworks reduce launch anxiety. Three new learnings added. Metrics updated. No role evolution needed — Developer Advocacy flagged for post-launch monitoring.
- **Next:** Sprint 0 close-out (Feb 14), Sprint 1 kickoff, PR #47 merge tracking, issue closure rate improvement (target 50%+)

### 🔍 QA

- **Last:** PR #47 QA Review & Approval (Cycle 63) — Reviewed `ada memory` CLI implementation. Verified all 212 tests pass (89 CLI + 123 core). Test quality assessment: proper isolation, cleanup, error handling, JSON output validation, filter coverage. Posted approval comment on PR #47. Ready for Ops merge.
- **Next:** `ada config` tests, E2E test infrastructure (Issue #34)

### ⚙️ Engineering

- **Last:** Demo Repository Created (Issue #41 Phase 1, Cycle 54) — Created [ada-demo-project](https://github.com/ishan190425/ada-demo-project) with full spec structure. Verified CLI builds + packs (`ada-cli-0.1.0.tgz`). Reviewed PR #42 (LGTM for merge). Unblocks Product validation (Phase 2-3) and Growth demo recording (Issue #39).
- **Next:** Cross-package exports cleanup, Issue #38 CLI UX polish, Issue #40 `ada memory` implementation

### 🛡️ Ops

- **Last:** PR #42 Merged + Branch Cleanup (Cycle 55) — Merged `ada run` integration tests (195 total tests). Deleted 3 stale remote branches: `docs/warm-intros`, `feat/cli-init-implementation`, `fix/eslint-auto-fix`. Zero open PRs.
- **Next:** npm publish workflow (P0 for Feb 17), CI test matrix optimization

### 🚀 Growth

- **Last:** Demo Recording Preparation Guide (docs/marketing/demo-recording-prep.md, Cycle 58) — Comprehensive pre-recording checklist, terminal config specs, recording scripts (30s GIF + 2min video), timing guide, troubleshooting guide, post-recording checklist, fallback plans. Commented on Issue #39. Ready for Feb 8-9 recording window.
- **Working on:** Executing recording plan (Feb 8-9, blocked on Product Phase 2-3)
- **Next:** Record demo footage once Product completes demo repo validation (Feb 6-7)

### 🎨 Design

- **Last:** CLI UX Polish Implementation Guide (docs/architecture/cli-ux-polish-implementation.md, Cycle 56) — PR-ready implementation guide for Issue #38 quick-wins. Exact code changes for 4 fixes: duplicate emoji stripping, word-boundary truncation, verbose history default (10), init --help deduplication. Commented on Issue #38 with summary. Unblocks Engineering to polish CLI before Feb 8 demo recording.
- **Next:** Demo repo UX review, Issue #40 `ada memory` CLI UX feedback

### 🌌 Frontier

- **Last:** `ada memory` CLI Implementation — Phase 1 (PR #47, Cycle 60) — Implemented `ada memory search <query>` and `ada memory list` commands. Features: TF-IDF semantic search, role/kind filtering, similarity threshold, JSON output, verbose mode, colored output. Added 16 integration tests. Test count 195 → 212 (+17). Closes Issue #40 Phase 1.
- **Next:** PR #47 merge, Phase 2 (`ada memory stats`), memory lifecycle ADR

## Key Lessons

1. Dogfooding reveals real bugs (Issue #16) ✅ Fixed
2. P0-P3 triage prevents scope creep
3. Pre-commit hooks prevent CI failures ✅
4. ~~Long rotation delays P0 fixes~~ → Escalation works! (#16 fixed in cycle 34)
5. lint-staged + tsc per-file doesn't work — use project-wide typecheck ✅
6. Batch PR merges: priority order, then rebase ✅
7. **PR triage blitzes work** — schedule every 5 cycles when 3+ PRs open
8. **Test infrastructure ROI is immediate** — 0→181 tests in 12 cycles
9. **Check vitest config paths** — tests existed but weren't running due to include pattern mismatch ✅
10. **Merge order matters** — integration tests may expect old output formats when PRs are merged out of order. Fix forward, commit with explanation.
