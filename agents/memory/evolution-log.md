### Init — Team Founded

**Initial roster created with 7 roles for ADA product development:**

| Role           | Name            | Justification                                            |
| -------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 👔 CEO         | The Founder     | Business strategy, competitive analysis, go-to-market    |
| 🔬 Research    | The Scout       | LLM frameworks, multi-agent systems, competitor analysis |
| 📦 Product     | The PM          | CLI features, dashboard, templates, pricing              |
| 📋 Scrum       | The Coordinator | Sprint planning, cross-package coordination              |
| ⚙️ Engineering | The Builder     | TypeScript/Node.js implementation across monorepo        |
| 🛡️ Ops         | The Guardian    | CI/CD, npm publishing, quality enforcement               |
| 🎨 Design      | The Architect   | CLI UX, API design, plugin architecture                  |

**Rationale:** These seven roles cover the full product development lifecycle for a developer tools SaaS: strategy → research → product → coordination → implementation → quality → design. ADA is dogfooding its own agent framework to build itself.
