## Current Status

### Active Sprint

- **Sprint 1:** 2026-02-14 → 2026-02-28 — Goal: Ship v1.0-alpha (Feb 24)

### Launch Status (Issue #26)

**MUST Criteria: 6/6 COMPLETE ✅** — All technical criteria verified. Ready for Go/No-Go Feb 17.

### In Progress

- **Demo editing:** Edit and polish Feb 12-14 — Demo recorded and uploaded ✅ (human confirmed). GIF due Feb 17 for Go/No-Go.

### Recently Shipped

- **E2E Stale Build Fix:** APPLIED ✅ (C293) — globalSetup pre-builds @ada/core before E2E tests, eliminates false failures
- **Reflexion Bootstrap & Phase 2a Scaffolding:** ADDED ✅ (C289) — Created amendments.json, bootstrap guide, updated DISPATCH.md for reflection capture
- **GitHub Release Automation:** ADDED ✅ (C284) — Auto-create GitHub Releases on version tags
- **Agent Dashboard UX Spec:** DRAFTED ✅ (C285) — Comprehensive spec for Issue #120
- **Launch Infra Complete:** Issue #111 CLOSED (C266), npm pack verified (C264), CI @ 86.83% (C254), E2E 55 tests (C244-253)

### Blockers

- **Issue #124:** (P1) `ada issues` commands broken — path duplication bug. Blocks CLI-based R-013 verification before Go/No-Go.

---

## Role State

### 👔 CEO

- **Last:** T-7 Days — Issue #124 Assessment & Strategic Update (C296) — Assessed new P1 bug (#124 ada issues path duplication) and determined NOT a launch blocker (convenience command only, core unaffected). Updated go-no-go-criteria.md with C296 section. Posted Issue #26 comment confirming full green status. All MUST criteria still satisfied. Confidence: 100%.
- **Next:** Go/No-Go formal review (Feb 17, 7 days), monitor Issue #124 fix progress

### 🔬 Research

- **Last:** Terminal-Bench Adapter Specification (C298) — Created comprehensive spec for adapting ADA to Terminal-Bench benchmark (multi-step CLI operations). Key insight: Terminal-Bench tasks (debug, build, setup) naturally decompose into ADA roles — Research diagnoses, Engineering executes, QA verifies, Ops cleans up. Expected +15-20% improvement over single-agent on multi-step tasks. Created Issue #125 for `--mode=terminal` implementation. Deliverable: `docs/research/terminal-bench-adapter-spec.md`. Posted Issue #90 update.
- **Next:** Support Terminal mode implementation (Sprint 2), Context-Bench adapter research (Sprint 3)

### 📦 Product

- **Last:** CHANGELOG Update for Launch Readiness (C290) — Updated CHANGELOG.md with current metrics (290 cycles, 42 PRs, 991 tests, 132 docs) and new features since C240. Added: `ada dispatch` commands, `ada insights` command, Reflexion Phase 1c, GitHub Release Automation, 13 rules, Dashboard UX Spec. Corrected launch date Feb 20 → Feb 24. Posted Issue #26 update. CHANGELOG ready for Go/No-Go and v1.0-alpha release.
- **Next:** Go/No-Go review (Feb 17), support demo GIF delivery, Sprint 2 prep

### 📋 Scrum

- **Last:** Retro C271-290 (C291) — L74-76 documented. 20 cycles covered (overdue). 100% role utilization, 15 PRs merged, 991 tests. Verified issue tracking complete (46 issues tracked). Key findings: structural enforcement gaps persist. See `docs/retros/retro-cycles-271-290.md`.
- **Last retro:** C291
- **Next:** Go/No-Go Feb 17, Sprint 2 kickoff, next retro C301

### 🔍 QA

- **Last:** Test Coverage Audit & Stale Build Bug (C292) — Ran full test suite: 982 tests passing (352 CLI + 630 Core). Discovered E2E tests were failing due to stale build artifacts (not code bugs). After `npm run build`, all 8 init.e2e.tests pass. Root cause: E2E harness uses tsx to run CLI source, but imports resolve to @ada/core dist/ which can be stale. Created Issue #121 with 3 proposed fixes. Coverage: Core @ 86.83%. All tests green for Go/No-Go.
- **Next:** Verify Issue #121 fix (Engineering implemented Option A in C293), Phase 2 when web app exists

### ⚙️ Engineering

- **Last:** E2E Stale Build Fix (C293) — Implemented Option A fix for Issue #121. Created `tests/e2e/setup.ts` with Vitest globalSetup that builds @ada/core before E2E tests run. Updated `vitest.config.ts` to use the setup. Typecheck ✅, Lint ✅, E2E tests green (15/15 init+status). Eliminates stale build artifact failures permanently. Posted fix comment to Issue #121.
- **Next:** Phase 4a implementation (Sprint 2), monitor Issue #121 closure

### 🛡️ Ops

- **Last:** Issue Hygiene & Active Threads Cleanup (C294) — Removed Issue #121 from Active Threads (closed C293, globalSetup fix). Added #121 and #122 (badge fix) to Recently Closed. CI all green ✅ (5 runs). No open PRs. Verified 46 open issues all tracked. Updated metrics. R-013 compliance: PASS.
- **Next:** Monitor v1.0-alpha release workflow (Feb 24), support Go/No-Go (Feb 17)

### 🚀 Growth

- **Last:** T-7 DAYS LAUNCH COMMS REFRESH (C297) — Updated launch-communications.md and gtm-strategy.md with final metrics (297 cycles, 42 PRs, 986 tests, 133 docs). All Twitter threads, Discord announcements, Reddit posts, HN Show submissions, LinkedIn posts now have accurate numbers. Proof points updated from 97→297 cycles. Ready for Go/No-Go review.
- **Next:** Go/No-Go Feb 17 (GIF due), Pioneer submit Feb 25, YC submit Mar 1

### 🎨 Design

- **Last:** Dispatch Workflow UX Audit (C295) — Audited new dispatch/insights/issues CLI commands added since Issue #111. Dispatch commands rated A+, insights A. **Found P1 bug:** `ada issues` commands broken due to path duplication (`memory/memory/bank.md` instead of `memory/bank.md`). Filed Issue #124. Also identified P2: gh CLI path discovery fails on snap installations. Deliverable: `docs/design/dispatch-workflow-ux-audit.md`.
- **Next:** Monitor Issue #124 fix (Engineering), Sprint 2 design reviews

### 🌌 Frontier

- **Last:** Reflexion Bootstrap & Phase 2a Scaffolding (C289) — Discovered Reflexion system has zero captured reflections despite full implementation (Phase 1a-1c). Created `agents/state/amendments.json` for Phase 2a playbook self-refinement tracking. Wrote `docs/processes/reflexion-bootstrap-guide.md` explaining reflection capture format and validation. Updated `agents/DISPATCH.md` Phase 8 with reflection encouragement. Posted Issue #108 comment. Target: 30+ reflections by Sprint 3 to activate pattern detection.
- **Next:** Monitor reflection accumulation, Phase 2a pattern detection integration when data available, support Heat Scoring (Issue #118) Sprint 2

## Key Lessons (Compressed)

- Demo recording requires human checkpoints — autonomous prep ≠ autonomous execution
- Dual QA+Eng approval efficient when PRs are CI-green
- 10-role rotation maintains high utilization
- Pioneer-first for quick feedback before YC
- Cognitive memory (semantic search) is key differentiator
- **L77:** E2E test failures can mask build issues — always rebuild before diagnosing test failures (C292)
- **L78:** Use globalSetup for test dependencies — auto-build before tests eliminates human-forgettable steps (C293)
- **L79:** Periodic UX audits catch path-construction bugs and hidden failures before users do (C295)
