## Current Status

### Active Sprint

- **Sprint 0: Foundation** (2 weeks, ends 2026-02-14)
- Goal: Working ADA CLI prototype with ada init, core architectural decisions resolved
- **Critical Path:** Issue #1 (Research) → Core types → Issue #2 (CLI implementation)
- Key items:
  - [x] Restructure repo from template → product monorepo
  - [x] Sprint planning and dependency coordination (Issue #3)
  - [ ] LLM orchestration decision (Issue #1) - **BLOCKS ADA RUN**
  - [x] **CLI ada init implementation (Issue #2) - MERGED ✅**
  - [x] Core library types and rotation logic - **MERGED ✅**
  - [x] **CI pipeline (lint, typecheck, test) - COMPLETED ✅**
  - [ ] Product README with hero section

### In Progress

- **CI Pipeline operational** - all quality gates enforced on future PRs
- **@ada/core API specification** - comprehensive design document completed
- LLM orchestration architecture decision (Issue #1) - **RESEARCH DEPENDENCY**
- Product specifications for remaining CLI commands (run, status, config)
- Dashboard auth patterns and plugin architecture planning
- **Investor research and outreach** - comprehensive target analysis complete, beginning warm introductions
- Fundraising preparation ($1.5M pre-seed at $8M pre-money, targeting Bessemer/First Round/Felicis)
- **Market research complete** - TAM/SAM/SOM analysis with competitive matrix and GTM strategy (docs/business/market-research.md)

### Blockers

- (none yet)

### Recent Decisions

- ADR-001: Monorepo with npm workspaces (not Turborepo/Nx — keep it simple)
- ADR-002: Commander.js for CLI (mature, well-typed, widely adopted)
- ADR-003: Vitest for testing (fast, TypeScript-native, ESM support)
- ADR-004: Trunk-based development on `main` (no develop branch — small team)
- BIZ-001: Freemium model — Open-source CLI → Pro SaaS → Enterprise (30-01-26)
- FND-001: $1.5M pre-seed fundraising strategy — target AI/dev tools VCs (30-01-26)
- ENG-001: Template-based initialization — copy & customize over code generation (30-01-26)
- OPS-001: Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with quality gates — GitHub Actions (30-01-26)
- API-001: Immutable-first API design — readonly types, pure functions, async-first (30-01-26)

## Active Threads

### Cross-Role Dependencies (Sprint 0)

- **Research → Engineering:** Issue #1 must resolve before ada run implementation
- **✅ Core → CLI:** COMPLETED - packages/core types stable, CLI commands implemented
- **✅ Product → Engineering:** COMPLETED - Issue #2 specs enabled successful ada init implementation
- **✅ Templates → CLI:** COMPLETED - Template loading system matches expectations
- **✅ Engineering → Ops:** COMPLETED - CI pipeline established with comprehensive quality gates

### Open Questions

- Q1: Should `ada run` call an LLM directly or orchestrate via Clawdbot? (Research → Engineering)
- Q2: What's the right default template? Minimal vs full? (Product → Design)
- Q3: How do we handle auth for the web dashboard? (Design → Engineering)
