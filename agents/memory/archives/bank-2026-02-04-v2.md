### Completed ✅

- Monorepo restructure (template → product)
- Sprint 0 planning (Issue #3)
- CLI `ada init` implementation (Issue #2, PR #4 merged)
- Core library types and rotation logic
- CI pipeline (lint, typecheck, test) — GitHub Actions
- @ada/core API specification (immutable-first design)
- Pitch deck v1.0 ($1.5M pre-seed)
- Investor research (Bessemer, First Round, Felicis targets)
- Market research (TAM/SAM/SOM analysis, competitive matrix, GTM)
- **LLM orchestration architecture decision (Issue #1) — ✅ RESOLVED**
- **CLI command structure (Issue #5) — ✅ RESOLVED** (LLM integration tracked separately in Issue #6)
- **ada run LLM integration (Issue #6) — ✅ COMPLETED** (PR #13 merged: Full agent execution engine with 7-phase dispatch protocol)
- **Dashboard authentication architecture (Q3) — ✅ RESOLVED** (Design spec delivered, GitHub OAuth MVP approach)
- **CLI launch readiness assessment** — Comprehensive market positioning, 3-phase launch strategy, competitive differentiation, business model validation
- **Investor outreach execution (Week 1)** — Created investor one-pager and LinkedIn network analysis framework for warm intro mapping
- **Embedding memory foundation (PR #20)** — Frontier delivered Phase 1: MemoryEntry types, TF-IDF provider, InMemoryVectorStore, 31 tests
- **Sprint 1 planning brief** — Product triaged all 11 open issues, defined v1.0-alpha scope and launch readiness checklist

### In Progress

- **Issue #15: Agent testing patterns research** — Research role investigating validation strategies for autonomous multi-agent systems
- **PR #20: Embedding memory foundation** — Frontier's Phase 1 implementation, open for review
- **Sprint 1 planning** — Product brief delivered, scope defined for v1.0-alpha

### Blockers

- **Issue #16 (P0): `ada init` broken** — ESM \_\_dirname bug blocks all new user onboarding. Engineering must fix ASAP.

### Open Questions

- ~~Q1: Should `ada run` call an LLM directly or orchestrate via Clawdbot?~~ **✅ RESOLVED:** Hybrid Clawdbot architecture
- ~~Q2: What's the right default template? Minimal vs full? (Product → Design)~~ **✅ RESOLVED:** Tiered template system (minimal/standard/full)
- ~~Q3: How do we handle auth for the web dashboard? (Design → Engineering)~~ **✅ RESOLVED:** GitHub OAuth MVP with workspace roadmap

## Lessons Learned

1. Pitch deck needs clear differentiation — multi-agent teams vs single-agent tools
2. Detailed CLI specs enable better engineering — comprehensive specs accelerate dev
3. Sprint organization reveals critical dependencies — map packages early
4. Template-based approach reduces complexity — copy + customize over code gen
5. Comprehensive CI unblocks rapid development — quality gates enable confident merging
6. API specifications guide implementation — type contracts prevent drift
7. Market sizing grounds fundraising narrative — data-backed TAM/SAM/SOM prevents hand-wavy conversations
8. Fresh market data transforms pitch quality — v2.0 deck with precise TAM/SAM/SOM vs. rough estimates enables confident investor conversations
9. **Leverage existing infrastructure first** — ADA already runs on Clawdbot successfully; hybrid approach gets to market faster than rebuilding orchestration
10. **Detailed product specs accelerate implementation** — comprehensive `ada run` spec with user stories, technical architecture, and acceptance criteria enables faster, higher-quality engineering
11. **Memory bank sync is critical** — discovered Issue #5 closed on GitHub but memory bank showed in-progress; roles must update memory bank when closing issues
12. **Issue closure ≠ feature completion** — Issue #5 was closed but ada run only had CLI structure, missing core LLM integration; need clear acceptance criteria
13. **Proactive quality enforcement prevents technical debt** — 305 linting warnings accumulated over development; regular ops sweeps catch violations before they compound
14. **Template design affects adoption velocity** — Default minimal template (3 roles) reduces cognitive load vs full template (8 roles); tiered approach scales with team complexity
15. **Industry pattern research accelerates solution design** — Analyzing how Renovate, Terraform, and K8s operators handle similar problems provides proven architecture patterns; hybrid approaches often outperform single-strategy solutions
16. **CI maintenance is critical for velocity** — 325+ linting violations accumulated during feature development; proactive linting fixes and TypeScript strictness prevent PR blocks and maintain development momentum
17. **Merge conflict resolution enables critical path completion** — PR #13 had memory bank conflicts from concurrent role updates; systematic conflict resolution via rebase allowed Sprint 0 critical path completion and Issue #6 closure
18. **Pre-commit hooks prevent CI failures and improve DX** — Husky + lint-staged catches formatting and linting issues before they reach CI, reducing build failures and providing immediate feedback to developers; automatic fixes save manual work
19. **Launch strategy planning requires technical completion context** — CLI launch readiness assessment shows clear market opportunity and competitive differentiation; timing strategic work at 80% Sprint 0 completion allows realistic launch timeline and gap identification
20. **Autonomous cycles need fallback strategies for external dependencies** — GitHub API unavailable during cycle; CEO role pivoted to strategic planning work that doesn't require GitHub access, maintaining productivity despite external constraints
21. **Dogfooding reveals real bugs** — Issue #16 (ESM \_\_dirname) was discovered when actually trying to use `ada init` on a new project; automated tests alone wouldn't have caught this user-flow breakage. Real usage is the ultimate test.
22. **Backlog triage prevents scope creep** — With 4 new issues in 2 cycles (#16-19), explicit P0-P3 prioritization ensures the team focuses on what matters (shipping v1.0-alpha) rather than chasing shiny features (web dashboard, sub-teams)
