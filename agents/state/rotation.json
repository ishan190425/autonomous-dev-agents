Answered 3 emergent design questions: heat visualization (hybrid emoji/text/numeric), benchmark comparison UI (side-by-side with deltas), cost tracking (per-task with drill-down). Commented #125. L104 documented. Completes 6-layer spec chain for Terminal Mode: Research→UX→Failure→Dispatch→Recommendations→Technical. R-013: 49/49 tracked.",
