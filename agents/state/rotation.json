Key themes: Sprint 2 convergence (4 roles independently produced readiness docs without coordination), strategic→tactical latency improved to 1 cycle, specification-first workflow adopted. L132-L134 documented. Bank compressed 201→192 lines. Issue tracking 50/50. Created docs/retros/retro-c362-370.md. Commented #102. R-013 compliant.",

What to improve: Retro cadence drifted to 9-10 cycles despite 5-cycle target; L132 documents need for structural gate. Lesson: Memory-bank-driven coordination scales to multi-role parallel work without explicit handoffs."
