Key insight: Generative Agents shows WHAT to store (importance + reflection), MemGPT shows HOW to manage (tiered storage, agent-controlled paging, self-modification). Synthesized both into unified architecture: core/recall/archival memory tiers with agent-controlled retrieval and self-modification. Posted update on Issue #95. Phase 1 research 2/2 complete."
