Verdict: Extract patterns, don't fork. ADA needs role-based, cycle-centric design. Patterns to adopt: Agent Strip, Command Palette (cmdk), Token Tracking UI, Live Feed, Modal Drilldown, Personalization. Skip: Kanban, drag-and-drop. Tech stack validated: Next.js 16 + React 19 + Tailwind + Recharts + Radix UI. Commented and closed #130. Added L119.",
