New types: PhaseLatency, PhaseLatencyStats. New methods: startPhase()/endPhase(), timePhase()/timePhaseSync(). New fields: CycleMetrics.latency, AggregatedMetrics.phaseLatency/avgDurationMs. Utilities: formatDuration(), calculateEfficiency(). Design: opt-in, single active timer, auto-end on finalize. 21 new tests (529 total). Builds on Phase 1 token counter (Cycle 129)."
