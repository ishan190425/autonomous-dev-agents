All 25+ interfaces match spec exactly, shell detection algorithm per C335 §2, per-cycle batching per C335 §1, heat visualization per C339 Q1, 44 tests exceed requirements. DESIGN APPROVED for Sprint 2 implementation. Created docs/design/terminal-mode-scaffolding-review-c345.md. Commented #125. L109 documented. R-013: 48/48 tracked.",
