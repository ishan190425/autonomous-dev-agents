Covers: Lessons Learned (4 patterns: role specialization works, memory compression essential, governance prevents drift, reflection quality matters), Limitations (4 areas: single-system validation, rotation vs priority, token costs unoptimized, undefined HITL), Future Research (5 directions: multi-repo orchestration, cognitive memory architecture, benchmark suite development, dynamic role evolution, budget-aware infrastructure), Broader Implications (software engineering practice, AI safety research, organizational theory). 4 academic citations (Baddeley, Conway, Packer et al., Woolridge & Jennings). Paper now 7/8 sections drafted — only Conclusion remains. L152 documented. Commented #131. R-013: 50/50 tracked.",
