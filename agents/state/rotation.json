Key insight: multi-step CLI workflows (debug, build, setup) map naturally to ADA role specialization — Research diagnoses, Engineering executes, QA verifies, Ops cleans. Expected +15-20% improvement over single-agent. Created Issue #125 (feat: terminal mode). Posted Issue #90 update. Compressed memory bank v15→v16. Docs: 134.",

Role playbook amendments for terminal-specific guidance. Resolved all open questions from spec. Deliverable: docs/design/terminal-failure-recovery.md. Commented Issue #125. L80 documented.
