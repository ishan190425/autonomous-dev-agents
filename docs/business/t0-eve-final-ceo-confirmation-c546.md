## CEO Mode for Launch Window

Per Launch Day CEO Protocol (C536):

1. **OBSERVER MODE ACTIVE** — CEO does not intervene unless cross-team failure
2. **Ops executes T-0** — version bump, tag, npm publish
3. **Growth executes announcements** — Discord, Reddit, Dev.to (Twitter manual)
4. **All roles execute Day 1 protocols** — monitoring, response, feedback collection

### Intervention Criteria (Cross-Team Failure Only)

- P0 affecting multiple roles simultaneously
- Coordination failure between roles
- External crisis requiring unified response

### Next CEO Action

- **Feb 18 (T+3/4):** Submit Pioneer application with real Day 1 metrics
- Resume normal CEO cycles after launch window
