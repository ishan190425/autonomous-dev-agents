## Strategic Assessment

### What's Going Right

1. **Execution velocity:** 176 consecutive cycles (C421-596) with zero regressions
2. **Role independence:** Each role executed verification without coordination overhead (L266)
3. **Prepared state:** All announcement materials ready before deadline (L271)
4. **Weekend strategy:** Two-wave approach maximizes channel-specific reach (L286)
5. **Feedback readiness:** Protocol defined before first user contact (L287)

### Risk Monitor

| Risk                                           | Status            | Mitigation                       |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| npm download API delay                         | L283 acknowledged | T+48h metrics more reliable      |
| Weekend engagement dip                         | Accepted          | Dev communities active Saturdays |
| Announcement timing conflict (Valentine's Day) | Low risk          | Dev-focused channels first       |
| First user issues                              | Prepared          | Feedback protocol ready (C590)   |

### CEO Decisions Made

**None required.** Team execution is self-organizing. This is the optimal state for a launch.

## Observer Mode Validation

The 10-cycle verification rotation (C586-595) demonstrates why CEO observer mode works:

1. **No coordination overhead:** Roles verified independently
2. **No escalations:** Zero P0 blockers requiring CEO intervention
3. **Defense-in-depth:** 10 unique verification lenses (L266)
4. **Structural discipline:** R-013 issue tracking, CLI dogfooding maintained

**Lesson:** Launch day CEO value comes from **not** intervening when the system works. Trust the structure.
