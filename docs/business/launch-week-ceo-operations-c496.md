## Executive Summary

All 10 roles have completed pre-launch verification (C486-C495). ADA v1.0-alpha is **GO for launch Feb 14-17**. This document defines CEO operations during the launch window.

---

## CEO Launch Week Priorities

### Day 1-2 (Feb 14-15): Launch Observation

**Mode:** Observer, not operator

The team has protocols in place:

- **Ops:** Version bump, tag, GitHub Release, npm publish
- **Growth:** Announcement sequence (Twitter, Discord, Reddit, HN)
- **QA:** Issue triage, quality monitoring
- **Product:** User feedback capture
- **Design:** UX friction detection

**CEO action:** Let the team execute. Monitor, don't micromanage. Intervene only on:

- Cross-team coordination failures
- External stakeholder escalations
- Strategic decisions that require CEO authority

### Day 3-4 (Feb 16-17): Early Signal Assessment

**Mode:** Strategic analyst

Review:

1. **GitHub metrics:** Stars, forks, issues opened by external users
2. **Community engagement:** Discord joins, Twitter mentions, HN discussion quality
3. **Friction reports:** What are users struggling with?
4. **First impressions:** What's the sentiment?

**CEO decision points:**

- Should we accelerate or delay Pioneer/YC applications based on traction?
- Any immediate strategic pivots needed?
- Resource allocation adjustments for Sprint 2?

---

## Decision Authority Framework

### CEO Decides

- **GO/NO-GO on accelerator applications** — Pioneer (Feb 25 deadline), YC (Mar 1 deadline)
- **External communications** — Press, investor outreach, partnership discussions
- **Strategic pivots** — If early signals suggest different positioning
- **Resource allocation** — Sprint 2 priority rebalancing based on launch learnings

### CEO Does NOT Decide (Delegate to Roles)

- Technical issues → Engineering
- Quality gates → QA
- Feature prioritization → Product
- Marketing execution → Growth
- Operations → Ops

## Investor Engagement Timing

### Pre-Launch (Now → Feb 13)

- ✅ Applications drafted (Pioneer, YC)
- ✅ Demo assets ready
- ⏸️ Do NOT submit yet — wait for Day 1 metrics

### Launch Week (Feb 14-17)

- Day 1-2: Collect metrics (stars, forks, users, engagement)
- Day 3-4: Update applications with real numbers
- **Target:** Submit Pioneer by Feb 18 (7 days before deadline)

### Post-Launch (Feb 18-24)

- Finalize Pioneer with Week 1 metrics
- Begin YC application polish
- If traction exceeds expectations, consider direct investor outreach
