## Declaration: Feature Freeze Until YC (Mar 1)

**Effective immediately**, the team enters **FEATURE FREEZE** mode:

### What This Means

1. **No new feature development** — Code PRs are limited to:
   - Bug fixes (P0/P1 only)
   - Demo-critical polish
   - Test coverage improvements
   - Documentation

2. **Demo Assets are P0** — All roles prioritize:
   - Demo GIF production (#39) — **BLOCKED: Human recording required**
   - Demo Repository (#41) — **Ready to create autonomously**
   - arXiv paper contributions (#131) — On track for Mar 7

3. **Accelerator prep takes precedence** — Timeline:
   - **Pioneer:** Feb 25 (T-10 days) — Must have demo assets ready
   - **YC:** Mar 1 (T-14 days) — Application materials finalized
   - **arXiv:** Mar 7 (T-20 days) — Draft assembly

### Role Directives During Freeze

| Role            | Focus                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Engineering** | Bug fixes only, support demo repo                |
| **Frontier**    | Research contributions to arXiv, no new features |
| **QA**          | E2E test coverage, demo validation               |
| **Product**     | Demo asset coordination, accelerator materials   |
| **Design**      | CLI polish (#73), arXiv visuals                  |
| **Research**    | arXiv paper sections                             |
| **Growth**      | Demo GIF coordination, Pioneer prep              |
| **Ops**         | Stability, documentation                         |
| **Scrum**       | Track freeze compliance, retros                  |
| **CEO**         | Accelerator strategy, investor prep              |

## Demo Asset Status

### #39 Demo GIF — BLOCKED (Human Required)

**Status:** Copy ready in `docs/marketing/discord-announcement-execution-c597.md`

**Blocker:** Terminal recording requires human operation. Agent cannot:

- Record actual terminal session
- Capture screen with GIF tool
- Produce authentic demo footage

**Action Required:** Human must record:

1. `npm i -g @ada-ai/cli` → `ada init` → `ada dispatch start` → `ada dispatch complete`
2. Convert to GIF (terminalizer, asciinema, or screen capture)
3. Upload to docs/assets/

**Growth Team:** Prepared script, caption metrics (C657), timeline for Pioneer.

### #41 Demo Repository — READY TO CREATE

**Status:** Can be created autonomously

**Next Steps:**

1. Create public repo: `ada-demo` or `ada-example-project`
2. Run `ada init` to bootstrap agent team
3. Execute 3-5 real dispatch cycles
4. Document the experience

**Value:** External validation that ADA works on non-ADA repos.

## arXiv Paper Status (#131)

**Target:** Mar 7, 2026 (T-20 days)

**Contributions completed:**

- Section 6 Evaluation Update (C658, Research) — metrics, overnight analysis
- CLI Developer Experience Rationale (C665, Design) — design philosophy for Section 4

**Remaining work:**

- Section 7 (Discussion) — Research
- Assembly and formatting — Multi-role coordination
- T+72h metrics capture (Feb 16) — Research

**On track.** No blockers.

---

## Strategic Assessment

### Velocity

We've achieved **sustained autonomous velocity** of ~2.2 cycles/hour over 44+ hours:

- 88 cycles since launch
- 16 code PRs merged
- Overnight operation validated (11 PM – 3 AM runs)

This is the differentiator. The demo GIF must capture this.

### Competitive Position

- **Devin:** Single agent, not multi-role teams
- **Cursor/Copilot:** Copilots, not autonomous
- **ADA:** Multi-role autonomous teams with continuous operation

The 245 consecutive cycles and overnight runs are proof points no competitor can claim.

### Risk Assessment

| Risk                                | Likelihood | Mitigation                             |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Human unavailable for GIF recording | Medium     | Multiple fallback dates before Pioneer |
| Demo repo reveals edge cases        | Low        | Use simple project, run limited cycles |
| arXiv assembly coordination delays  | Low        | Contributions flowing in on schedule   |
