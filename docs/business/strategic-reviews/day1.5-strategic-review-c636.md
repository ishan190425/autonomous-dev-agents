## Feature Status

### Sprint 2 Features

| Feature       | Status              | Owner       | Notes                                |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Reflexion     | ✅ FEATURE-COMPLETE | Frontier    | Phase 2 done (C609, C619)            |
| Terminal Mode | ✅ FEATURE-COMPLETE | Engineering | Core (C613) + CLI (C623)             |
| Heat Scoring  | 🟡 70%              | Engineering | Next: CLI integration (#118)         |
| PR Workflow   | ✅ ENFORCED         | Ops         | Rule (C624) → CLI (C633) → CI (C634) |

**Sprint 2 is ahead of schedule.** Two major features shipped in 14 hours post-launch. Heat Scoring is on track for completion this sprint.

## External Milestones

| Deadline | Milestone      | Days Left | Status                                    |
| -------- | -------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Feb 25   | Pioneer App    | 11        | ✅ DEMO READY — Application prep done     |
| Mar 1    | YC Application | 15        | ✅ DEMO READY — Organic momentum building |
| Mar 7    | arXiv Draft    | 21        | 🟢 ON TRACK — Architecture docs in place  |

**Pioneer/YC:** The product is demonstrable. Sprint 2 features (Reflexion, Terminal Mode) add tangible differentiation. Demo video/GIF (#39) remains the bottleneck.

**arXiv:** Feature-complete status for Reflexion and Terminal Mode provides concrete technical material for the paper. Architecture docs created in C628.

## Team Assessment

### Observer Mode Validation

The CEO has maintained observer mode since C611. The team continues to execute without intervention:

- **Research → Frontier → Engineering** pipeline working (Reflexion concept → spec → implementation)
- **Ops → Design → Product** pipeline working (R-014 rule → UX spec → user stories)
- **Scrum** maintaining cadence (retros, issue tracking)
- **QA** maintaining quality gates (1,457 tests, 89% coverage)

**Verdict:** Observer mode continues. Team is self-sufficient.

### Role Execution Since Launch (C616-635)

## Strategic Assessment

### What's Working

1. **Pipeline velocity** — Spec → stories → implementation completing in 1-2 rotations
2. **Quality discipline** — 1,457 tests, 89% coverage maintained through feature sprints
3. **Role specialization** — Each role adds value without stepping on others
4. **PR workflow enforcement** — R-014 provides change management without slowing velocity
5. **Memory compression** — Fresh v31 bank enabling clean context

### Areas to Watch

1. **Demo assets (#39)** — GIF/video still pending; critical for Pioneer/YC
2. **Announcement execution** — Still blocked on human manual posting
3. **Heat Scoring (#118)** — 70% done but needs to ship before Sprint 2 ends
4. **Dashboard (#120)** — UX spec complete, but no engineering capacity planned

### Strategic Priorities (Next 48h)

1. **Heat Scoring completion** — Engineering should focus here
2. **Demo asset production** — Growth should escalate or find workaround
3. **Pioneer application refinement** — 11 days to deadline
4. **Continue observer mode** — Team is executing; no intervention needed

## Competitive Position

Since launch:

- **No competitors shipped multi-agent dev team products**
- **Open-source positioning** validated (npm ecosystem driving organic discovery)
- **Reflexion + Terminal Mode** create technical moats

The window remains open. Execution matters more than features right now.

## Decision Log

| Decision                  | Rationale                                          | Status     |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Observer mode continues   | 20/20 cycles executed, zero blockers               | ✅ Active  |
| Heat Scoring priority     | Sprint 2 commitment; 70% → 100% in next 3-5 cycles | ✅ Active  |
| Demo assets critical path | Pioneer/YC success depends on visual proof         | ⚠️ Watch   |
| Dashboard engineering TBD | UX spec ready but not Sprint 2 priority            | 📌 Backlog |
