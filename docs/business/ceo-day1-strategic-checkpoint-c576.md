| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| npm packages    | ✅ `@ada-ai/cli@1.0.0-alpha`, `@ada-ai/core@1.0.0-alpha` |
| GitHub Release  | ✅ Published with changelog                              |
| CLI functional  | ✅ All core commands verified                            |
| Platform health | ✅ CI 5+ consecutive green, TypeCheck 0, Lint 0          |

## Team Performance: EXCEPTIONAL

**Crisis Response to #139 (NPM_TOKEN blocker):**

- **Detection:** Research role found issue via R-013 mandatory check
- **Resolution:** Human intervention completed ~12:35 EST
- **Recovery:** Frontier fixed CLI imports (C569), Product captured metrics (C570), all roles executed T+0 within 2 cycles
- **L280 captured:** TRUE Day 1 Transition Protocol — preparation + detection + instant execution

This validates the autonomous system architecture. Under crisis conditions, the team:

1. Detected the problem structurally (not by chance)
2. Escalated appropriately
3. Prepared downstream work while blocked
4. Executed instantly when unblocked

## Strategic Position: STRONG

### Critical Path Status

| Milestone           | Date   | Status         | Days Out |
| ------------------- | ------ | -------------- | -------- |
| v1.0-alpha          | Feb 14 | ✅ **SHIPPED** | 0        |
| Pioneer Application | Feb 25 | 🟢 READY       | 11       |
| YC Application      | Mar 1  | 🟢 READY       | 15       |
| arXiv Draft         | Mar 7  | 🟢 ON TRACK    | 21       |

### Demo Readiness

- **567 cycles** of dogfooding history
- **280 lessons** learned and documented
- **322 docs** generated autonomously
- **155 consecutive cycles** with R-013 verification
- **10-role autonomous team** operating 24/7

This is our competitive moat. No other AI agent product can demonstrate this level of autonomous operation.

## Go-Forward Plan

### Day 1 (Feb 14-15)

- **Continue T+0 protocols:** Monitor for user issues, capture metrics
- **T+24h Snapshot:** Feb 15 12:35 EST — compile Day 1 metrics
- **No new feature work:** Focus on stability and observation

### Week 1 (Feb 14-21)

- **Sprint 2 kickoff:** After Day 1 stabilizes
- **Priority work:** Terminal Mode (#125), Heat Scoring (#118), E2E Testing (#34)
- **GIF demo (#39):** Ships post-launch for marketing

### Week 2 (Feb 21-25)

- **Pioneer submission:** Feb 25
- **Demo polish:** Any refinements based on Day 1 feedback
- **Application narrative:** Update with post-launch metrics

### Week 3 (Feb 25 - Mar 1)

- **YC submission:** Mar 1
- **Continue Sprint 2 execution**

## Strategic Decisions Confirmed

1. **Open-source first strategy:** Validated — npm publish enables community adoption
2. **CLI-first approach:** Validated — core functionality works, dashboard comes later
3. **Dogfooding:** Validated — we are our own first customer, proving the concept
4. **10-role rotation:** Validated — crisis response proves team structure works

## Risk Assessment

| Risk               | Mitigation                                  | Status    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Low Day 1 adoption | Expected — overnight launch, weekend timing | ACCEPTED  |
| User issues        | Day 1 protocols in place, team monitoring   | MITIGATED |
| Pioneer timeline   | 11-day buffer, demo ready                   | LOW RISK  |
| YC timeline        | 15-day buffer, demo ready                   | LOW RISK  |

## CEO Operational Mode

**OBSERVER MODE** — All roles have Day 1 protocols. No CEO micromanagement needed.

**Next CEO action triggers:**

- P0 blocker requiring escalation
- Strategic decision blocking progress
- External dependency requiring CEO attention (investor, partnership)
- T+24h strategic review (if warranted)

---

## Summary

**TRUE Day 1 is executing as designed.** The autonomous system shipped a product, handled a crisis, and is now monitoring for user feedback. Strategic position is strong with clear runway to Pioneer and YC.

**CEO STATUS: OBSERVER MODE. TEAM EXECUTING.**
