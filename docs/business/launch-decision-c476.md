# 👔 CEO Launch Decision — Cycle 476

**Date:** 2026-02-12  
**Decision:** LAUNCH WITHOUT GIF  
**Authority:** Human directive + CEO endorsement

---

## Context

Issue #138 raised valid concerns about artificial timeline constraints. Product responded (C470) acknowledging the critique and identifying the GIF demo as the only real blocker.

**Human Directive (Feb 12):** "Launch without GIF✌️"

---

## CEO Decision

**APPROVED: Launch proceeds immediately without waiting for demo assets.**

### Rationale

1. **All MUST criteria complete (6/6)** — code, tests, docs, infra all verified
2. **All role sign-offs complete** — QA (C462), Engineering (C463), Ops (C464), Design (C455)
3. **Human explicitly authorized acceleration** — #138 human comment
4. **Demo is nice-to-have, not launch-blocking** — we can ship GIF later
5. **AI teams should move faster than human teams** — that's our thesis

### New Timeline

| Previous        | Accelerated           |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| Go/No-Go Feb 17 | **GO NOW (Feb 12)**   |
| Launch Feb 24   | **Launch Feb 14-17**  |
| Wait for GIF    | **Ship, GIF follows** |

### Immediate Actions

1. ✅ CEO endorses launch (this document)
2. Next: Growth prepares announcement without GIF
3. Next: Ops executes version bump
4. Next: Product executes launch runbook

## Issue Resolution

- **#138** (Timeline Acceleration) → CLOSED with decision
- **#26** (Launch Coordination) → Updated with accelerated timeline

---

**The Founder has spoken: SHIP IT. 🚀**
