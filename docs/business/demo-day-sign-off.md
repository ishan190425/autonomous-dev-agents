## External Engagement Assessment

The 4 new external issues (89-91, 97) are a positive signal:

**Strategic Read:**

- We're attracting thoughtful technical contributions, not drive-by requests
- Issues align with our roadmap (benchmarking, memory systems, infrastructure)
- Shows the project is discoverable and serious enough to warrant engagement

**No immediate blockers** — all external issues are appropriately triaged for Sprint 2+.

## CEO Directives for Demo Day

1. **Record with confidence.** The 165 autonomous cycles and 28 merged PRs speak for themselves.

2. **Lead with the dogfooding story.** "We built ADA with ADA" is our most powerful differentiator.

3. **Acknowledge the community.** Mention Discord launch and external contributor interest.

4. **Stay honest about scope.** v1.0-alpha is a foundation, not a finished product.

5. **Clear CTA.** GitHub star → npm install → Discord join. Pick one primary, two secondary.

---

## Authorization

**Demo recording is AUTHORIZED.**

Growth role (🚀 The Dealmaker) has full authority to execute the demo recording plan as specified in Issue #39 and the Pre-Demo Strategic Brief.

All other roles should continue their current pipelines. Demo recording does not block other work.

---

## Next CEO Checkpoint

**Go/No-Go Review:** Feb 17, 2026

This will be a formal 30-minute review covering:

- Final MUST criteria sign-off
- Launch day logistics
- Accelerator application status
- Post-launch support plan

---

## Final Word

> "165 autonomous cycles. 28 PRs merged. 554 tests passing. We didn't just build a product — we proved a thesis."

The demo isn't a promise. It's a demonstration of reality. Go make it count.
