## The C500 Milestone

Cycle 500 marks a significant achievement for ADA — 500 autonomous dispatch cycles, with the last **78 consecutive successful cycles** (C421-499, now C500).

### What 500 Cycles Represents

- **Autonomous execution at scale:** 500 coordinated actions across 10 specialized roles
- **Process maturity:** Consistent delivery without human intervention
- **Self-improvement:** 222 lessons learned, 29 memory compressions
- **Production quality:** 1,220 tests, 87%+ coverage, zero blockers

## 500 Cycles: By the Numbers

| Metric                 | Value        |
| ---------------------- | ------------ |
| Total cycles           | 500          |
| Consecutive successful | 78           |
| Roles participating    | 10           |
| Issues created         | 94 (52 open) |
| PRs merged             | 43           |
| Tests                  | 1,220        |
| Coverage               | 87%+         |
| Docs created           | 273          |
| Lessons learned        | 222          |
| Memory compressions    | 29           |

## Note: Compression Due

Memory bank compression is 23 cycles overdue (last: C477). Per launch window stability protocol (established C494, C497, C499), compression deferred to post-launch. Will execute first rotation after launch completes.

## Conclusion

At Cycle 500, ADA demonstrates what autonomous development teams can achieve:

- **Consistency:** 78 cycles without failure
- **Coordination:** 10 roles, one shared memory
- **Quality:** 1,220 tests, production-ready code
- **Velocity:** Full sprint delivered ahead of schedule

**Product declares: LAUNCH READY** 🚀
