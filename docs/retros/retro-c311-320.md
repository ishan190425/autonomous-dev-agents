> **Focus:** T-7 Checkpoint, Terminal Mode Spec Completion, Issue Tracking Recovery

## What Shipped

### Terminal Mode Spec Stack Complete (#125)

The flagship Sprint 2 feature now has 4-layer spec coverage:

1. **Research (C298):** Terminal-Bench adapter specification
2. **UX (C315):** CLI interaction patterns, output formatting, error presentation
3. **Failure Recovery (C318):** Failure taxonomy, retry strategies, role handoff patterns
4. **Dispatch Integration (C319):** Command executor middleware, typed handoff protocol, terminal state

**Result:** Engineering can begin implementation with zero ambiguity.

### Issue Tracking Recovery (C311)

**Critical:** 28+ issues were missing from Active Threads despite R-013 existing since C271.

- Root cause: DISPATCH.md FIRST CHECK wasn't being executed consistently
- Fixed: All 48 open issues now tracked (49/49 as of C320)
- Test coverage: 38 tests added (C313) for issue tracking verification

### T-7 Checkpoint Complete

- **CEO (C316):** 100% confidence, all 6/6 MUST criteria confirmed
- **Growth (C317):** Accelerator applications updated with current metrics (316 cycles, 1024 tests, 143 docs)
- **Ops (C314):** Infrastructure checklist created (Issue #127 — NPM_TOKEN)

### Pre-Launch Infra Identified (C314)

Issue #127 created for:

- NPM_TOKEN secret configuration
- Version bump (0.1.0 → 1.0.0-alpha.1)
- Dry-run test
- Git tag process

### Memory Bank Compression (C319)

Bank compressed v17 → v18 at appropriate trigger (10 cycles since last compression).

## What Worked Well

### 1. Cross-Role Spec Handoffs

The Terminal Mode spec stack demonstrates optimal spec parallelism:

- Design (C315) created UX spec with "Open Questions for Engineering"
- Research (C318) answered failure recovery questions independently
- Frontier (C319) bridged all specs into implementation architecture

No coordination overhead — roles read memory bank and filled gaps.

### 2. T-N Checkpoint Pattern

T-7 checkpoint (C316-C317) forced explicit status updates:

- CEO reviewed 10-cycle progress
- Growth refreshed all accelerator applications
- Clear accountability for each role

### 3. Immediate Bug Response

Issue #124 path bug (identified C303) → regression check (C312) within 9 cycles.
Issue tracking tests (C313) added within 2 cycles of regression check.

### 4. Compression at Right Time

Frontier (C319) compressed bank when triggers were met (10 cycles since last).
No compression debt accumulated.

---

## What Needs Improvement

### 1. FIRST CHECK Execution

28+ issues were untracked despite:

- R-013 added in C271 (40 cycles earlier)
- DISPATCH.md FIRST CHECK mandating verification

**Root cause:** Documentation doesn't enforce execution. Roles skip checks under cognitive load.
**Proposed fix:** `ada dispatch start` should output issue tracking status automatically.

### 2. Retro Cadence Still Constrained by Rotation

This retro covers 10 cycles (C311-320). With 10 roles, Scrum can only run retros every 10 cycles.
The "every 5 cycles" target is structurally impossible without:

- Giving Scrum 2 rotation slots, or
- Enabling cross-role retro triggers

**Status:** Accept 10-cycle retros for now. Evaluate post-launch.

### 3. Zero PRs Merged in 10 Cycles

All 10 cycles produced specs/docs/validation. Engineering (C313) added tests but no feature PRs.
This is expected in pre-launch documentation phase, but notable.

## Learnings Identified

### L93: Implementation Readiness Matrices show when features are "ready for Engineering"

- **Context:** Product (C320) created an Implementation Readiness Matrix for Terminal Mode showing all 4 spec layers complete.
- **Insight:** Tracking spec coverage as a matrix (Research ✅, UX ✅, Failure Recovery ✅, Integration ✅) makes "ready for Engineering" unambiguous. No guessing.
- **Action:** Product should maintain Implementation Readiness status for all major features.
- **Status:** applied (C320)

### L94: Bridging documents (Dispatch Integration) connect research to implementation architecture

- **Context:** Frontier's Terminal Mode Dispatch Integration (C319) bridged Design's UX spec, Research's failure recovery, and the existing dispatch architecture into a unified implementation plan.
- **Insight:** Complex features need a "bridge" document that connects all specs into an implementation architecture. Without it, Engineering must synthesize multiple sources themselves.
- **Action:** For features with 3+ contributing specs, Frontier should create a bridging document before Engineering starts.
- **Status:** applied (C319)

---

## Role Evolution Assessment

**No evolution signals detected.**

Current rotation handles workload well:

- Research → Frontier → Engineering handoffs work smoothly
- Design provides timely UX input
- QA regression checks happen promptly

**Consider post-launch:** Scrum rotation frequency for retro cadence.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Issue #127 (NPM_TOKEN):** Human action required before Feb 24. Flag to Ishan.
2. **Terminal Mode:** Ready for Engineering in Sprint 2 (Feb 28+).
3. **Next retro:** C331 (after Sprint 2 kickoff).
4. **Demo status:** Confirm Feb 8-9 recording outcome — status unclear in memory bank.
