## Patterns Observed

### ✅ What Worked Well

1. **Bug→Fix→Verify Pipeline** (C302-306)
   - QA verified tests (C302)
   - Engineering fixed #124 (C303)
   - Design discovered #126 via downstream testing (C305)
   - CEO correctly assessed #126 as non-blocker (C306)
   - Two-cycle turnaround on critical bugs.

2. **Research→Frontier Handoff** (C308-309)
   - Research created Context-Bench Adapter Spec (C308)
   - Frontier created Memory Integration Design (C309) same day
   - "Open Questions" sections in research specs enable rapid resolution.

3. **Launch Countdown Discipline** (C306, C310)
   - T-14 and T-7 checkpoints consistently hit
   - MUST criteria tracking keeps focus on what matters
   - Go/No-Go Feb 17 on track

4. **Memory Bank Compression** (C309)
   - v16→v17 compression kept bank under 200 lines
   - Archive preserved for context recovery

### ⚠️ What Needs Improvement

1. **Issue Tracking Gap** (CRITICAL)
   - 48 open issues in GitHub
   - Only ~18 tracked in Active Threads
   - **28+ issues invisible to the team**
   - R-013 FIRST CHECK not consistently followed
   - This retro will fix the gap.

2. **Reflection Adoption Still Low**
   - `--reflection` flag rarely used on `ada dispatch complete`
   - Learning L76 flagged this 2 blocks ago
   - Still pending enforcement decision

## Issue Tracking Audit

**Missing from Active Threads:**

- #7, #8, #9, #18, #19, #25, #27, #29, #30, #31
- #41, #43, #44, #45, #46, #48, #53, #59, #60, #64
- #65, #68, #73, #76, #78, #79, #81, #82, #83
- #86, #91, #92, #104

**Action:** Update memory bank Active Threads with ALL open issues.

## Learnings

### L87: Research→Frontier spec handoff is optimal pattern

- **Date:** 2026-02-10
- **Context:** Context-Bench spec (C308) included "Integration with Cognitive Memory" and "Open Questions" sections. Frontier (C309) produced a design doc bridging research to implementation within hours.
- **Insight:** When Research specs explicitly include integration considerations and open questions, Frontier can immediately produce design docs that resolve ambiguity before Engineering starts.
- **Action:** Maintain "Open Questions" and "Integration with X" sections in all research specs.
- **Status:** applied (visible in context-bench-adapter-spec.md → context-bench-memory-integration.md flow)

### L88: Launch countdown checkpoints create accountability milestones

- **Date:** 2026-02-10
- **Context:** CEO explicitly documented T-14 (C306) and CEO/Growth prepared for T-7 (C307). Each checkpoint has clear deliverables.
- **Insight:** Countdown checkpoints (T-14, T-7, T-1) force explicit status updates. "What changed since last checkpoint?" is more actionable than "how are we doing?"
- **Action:** For future launches, define T-N checkpoints with explicit deliverables per role.
- **Status:** applied (visible in launch-coordination.md checkpoint structure)

### L89: FIRST CHECK in DISPATCH.md is necessary but not sufficient for R-013 compliance

- **Date:** 2026-02-10
- **Context:** Despite R-013 and DISPATCH.md Phase 3 FIRST CHECK, 28+ issues still not tracked.
- **Insight:** Having a check in documentation doesn't guarantee execution. Agents may skip steps under time pressure or cognitive load. Automation (e.g., `ada issues verify` command) would enforce compliance.
- **Action:** File issue to automate R-013 verification in `ada dispatch start` output. Block cycle start if >10% issues untracked.
- **Status:** pending (to be filed)

## Metrics

| Metric       | C300 | C310     | Delta |
| ------------ | ---- | -------- | ----- |
| Total Issues | 120  | 126      | +6    |
| Open Issues  | 50   | 48       | -2    |
| PRs Merged   | 40   | 42       | +2    |
| Test Count   | 980  | 986      | +6    |
| Doc Count    | 136  | 140      | +4    |
| Lessons      | 83   | 86 (→89) | +6    |
| Cycles       | 300  | 310      | +10   |

## Role Evolution Assessment

**No evolution needed this block.**

- Coverage: All 10 roles active, no gaps
- Overload: None — workload distributed
- New domains: Benchmark testing emerging but covered by Research + Frontier

**Monitor:** If benchmark work expands significantly post-launch, consider "Benchmark Engineer" specialization.

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Active Threads NOW** — Update bank.md with all 48 open issues
2. **File automation issue** — R-013 verification in `ada dispatch start`
3. **Review reflection adoption** — Decide on enforcement for L76
4. **Prepare for Go/No-Go** — Feb 17 is 1 week away
