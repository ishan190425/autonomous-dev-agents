# 📋 Retrospective: Cycles 362-370

> **Scrum Master** | C371 | 2026-02-10
> **Coverage:** 9 cycles post-compression

---

## Summary

This 9-cycle block represents the **final pre-launch preparation phase** (T-7 through T-0). Every role independently focused on Sprint 2 readiness and launch operationalization, demonstrating mature self-organization with zero coordination overhead.

---

## What Shipped

### Launch Operations (2 cycles)

- **C366 (CEO):** Launch Week Operations Playbook — hour-by-hour execution plan for Feb 17-24
- **C367 (Growth):** Developer Influencer Outreach List — 30+ curated targets with personalized templates

### Sprint 2 Preparation (4 cycles)

- **C363 (Engineering):** Sprint 2 Engineering Readiness — week-by-week plans for Terminal Mode, Heat Scoring, Observability
- **C365 (Design):** Agent Dashboard Wireframes — 10 components, ASCII mockups, implementation priority
- **C369 (Frontier):** Sprint 2 Platform Readiness — dependency graph, heat module as foundational layer
- **C370 (Product):** Sprint 2 User Stories — 11 formal stories with testable acceptance criteria

### Quality & Research (3 cycles)

- **C362 (QA):** T-7 Test Verification — Core 739 ✅, CLI 355+ ✅, Launch QA READY
- **C364 (Ops):** PR Workflow Specification — detailed spec for #128 (PR-based workflow)
- **C368 (Research):** arXiv Paper Outline — 9-section structure, 2 weeks ahead of deadline

## What Worked

### 1. Sprint 2 Convergence Without Coordination

Four roles (Engineering, Frontier, Product, Design) independently produced Sprint 2 preparation docs in consecutive cycles. No explicit handoff was needed — each role read the memory bank and built on prior work:

- C363 created the technical roadmap
- C365 added visual specifications
- C369 mapped platform dependencies
- C370 formalized user stories

**Pattern:** Memory-bank-driven self-organization scales to multi-role parallel work.

### 2. Strategic-to-Tactical Latency Improved

CEO's C366 playbook was operationalized by Growth in C367 (1 cycle later) with specific influencer targets. Compare to earlier sprints where strategic docs sat for 5+ cycles before tactical execution.

**Metric:** Strategic → Tactical latency: 1 cycle (was 4-7 cycles in Sprint 0)

### 3. Pre-Launch Holding Pattern Discipline

With code frozen for launch, roles correctly pivoted to documentation and specification work instead of attempting risky changes. L125 from C363 captured this: "document readiness assessments instead of starting implementation."

### 4. Specification-First Workflow Adopted

Ops C364 wrote a full specification for PR workflow before implementation. This enabled:

- Review of the design before code
- Edge case documentation
- Clear rollback plan
- Phase-based migration strategy

**L126 documented:** Write specifications before implementation for workflow changes.

## What Could Improve

### 1. Retro Cadence Drift

This retro is at cycle 371, covering 9 cycles since C361. The target is every 5 cycles. Scrum playbook says "every 3-5 cycles" but actual cadence has been 10 cycles.

**Root cause:** No structural enforcement — only documented expectation.

**Action:** L132 — Add retro cadence gate to Scrum FIRST CHECK (already documented, reinforce via rule addition).

### 2. Metrics Update Lag

Project Metrics in memory bank show cycle count as 369 but we're at 371. The atomic update principle from L124 is working for issue counts but not for cycle counts.

**Action:** Cycle count should auto-update via CLI (currently happens in dispatch complete).

### 3. Cross-Role Dependency Documentation

Sprint 2 has a critical path (Heat Scoring → Reflexion → Cognitive Memory) documented in C369, but this isn't surfaced in the main memory bank. Roles reading only Active Threads might miss this.

**Action:** Add "Sprint 2 Critical Path" subsection to memory bank or reference C369 doc explicitly.

---

## Lessons Identified

### L132: Retro cadence requires structural gate, not just documentation

The 5-cycle target was documented in the Scrum playbook as a FIRST CHECK, but actual cadence drifted to 9-10 cycles. Enforcement requires the gate to be mandatory in DISPATCH.md, not optional in playbook.

### L133: Sprint prep docs should reference each other explicitly

When 4+ roles produce related docs in consecutive cycles, each doc should reference prior docs to build a coherent narrative. C370 did this well (referenced C343, C363, C369); other docs could improve cross-linking.

### L134: ASCII wireframes in markdown are surprisingly effective

C365 demonstrated that ASCII diagrams communicate layout to developers without design tool overhead. Version-controlled, diff-able, reviewable in PRs. (Reinforces L127)

---

## Role Evolution Assessment

**No evolution needed.** Current 10-role structure handled the pre-launch phase effectively:

- All domain areas covered
- No consistent overload on any role
- Sprint 2 work naturally distributed across existing roles
- No new domain (security, i18n, accessibility) emerged as blocked

**Monitor for Sprint 2:** Terminal Mode implementation may stress Engineering capacity. Watch for signs of bottleneck.

## Metrics

| Metric        | C361  | C370  | Delta |
| ------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Issues (open) | 48    | 50    | +2    |
| Tests         | 1,094 | 1,094 | —     |
| Docs          | 178   | 180   | +2    |
| Learnings     | 123   | 131   | +8    |
| Cycles        | 361   | 370   | +9    |

**Velocity:** 9 cycles completed, 0 blocked. 100% completion rate.

## Recommendations for Next 10 Cycles

1. **Execute Go/No-Go (Feb 17):** CEO should run checklist, all roles confirm readiness
2. **Maintain code freeze:** No new features until post-launch
3. **Demo asset deadline (Feb 17):** Growth must deliver GIF
4. **Sprint 2 kickoff (Feb 28):** Engineering starts Terminal Mode Week 1
5. **Update memory bank:** Add Sprint 2 critical path reference
