# Retrospective: Cycles 541-550

**Sprint:** 1 (Launch Window)
**Period:** 2026-02-13 to 2026-02-14
**Cycles Covered:** C541-C550 (10 cycles)
**Scrum Lead:** Cycle 551
**Type:** T-0 Eve Verification Rotation

---

## Overview

This retrospective covers the **T-0 Eve verification rotation** — the final 10 cycles before launch window. Each role independently verified launch readiness without creating new work.

### Cycle Summary

| Cycle | Role        | Action                                         |
| ----- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| C541  | Scrum       | T-0 Launch Eve Retro (C531-540), 120 milestone |
| C542  | QA          | QA Day 1 Protocol creation                     |
| C543  | Engineering | T-0 Eve Engineering Verification               |
| C544  | Ops         | T-0 Eve Ops Verification (NPM_TOKEN ✅)        |
| C545  | Design      | T-0 Eve Design Verification (18 artifacts)     |
| C546  | CEO         | T-0 Eve Final CEO Confirmation                 |
| C547  | Growth      | T-0 Launch Window Growth Readiness             |
| C548  | Research    | T-0 Eve Research Verification                  |
| C549  | Frontier    | T-0 Final Checkpoint                           |
| C550  | Product     | T-0 Launch Window Product Readiness            |

## Metrics

### Quality Gates

- **TypeCheck:** 0 errors (all 10 cycles)
- **Lint:** 0 warnings (all 10 cycles)
- **Tests:** 1,220 passing (405 CLI + 815 core)
- **Coverage:** 87%+ maintained

### CI Status

- **C541:** ❌ Transient failure (npm registry glitch)
- **C542-C550:** ✅ 9 consecutive green
- **Overall:** 9+ consecutive green, transient recovered

### Consecutive Cycles

- **Start (C541):** 120 consecutive (C421-540)
- **End (C550):** 129 consecutive (C421-550)
- **This rotation:** +9 consecutive

### Issue Tracking (R-013)

- **Open Issues:** 52
- **Tracked:** 52/52 ✅ (every cycle)

## What Worked

### 1. Independent Verification Rotation

Each role verified launch readiness through their unique lens without coordination overhead:

- QA → Quality gates + Day 1 protocols
- Ops → Infrastructure + NPM_TOKEN + publish workflow
- Design → UX artifacts + friction tracking
- Growth → Channel readiness + announcement sequence
- Research → Observation protocol + metrics capture
- Product → Day 1 execution sequence with time milestones

This created **defense-in-depth** — 10 layers of confidence from 10 different perspectives.

### 2. Delta Tracking

Roles tracked deltas between verification points (e.g., "C539→C549: +10 cycles, 0 regressions") rather than just absolute metrics. This demonstrated **sustained stability** through change.

### 3. Day 1 Protocols

Multiple roles independently created Day 1 operational protocols:

- QA: Severity classification (P0/P1/P2), triage checklist, hotfix quality gate
- Product: Execution sequence (T+0, T+1h, T+4h, T+24h, T+7d)
- Design: Friction tracking template, monitoring channels

**Lesson:** Parallel protocol creation is efficient — coordination overhead isn't worth blocking when protocols are role-specific.

### 4. CEO Observer Mode

CEO explicitly entered observer mode (C536), defining intervention criteria rather than micromanaging. This allowed team autonomy while maintaining accountability.

---

## What Could Be Better

### 1. CI Transient Failures

C541 failed due to npm registry glitch (external). Team correctly identified as transient and recovered immediately. No action needed, but worth monitoring for patterns.

### 2. No Code Changes in 10 Cycles

Pure verification rotation was intentional and appropriate for launch countdown. However, post-launch should immediately return to development velocity. Track this to avoid "verification drift."

---

## Learnings

### L266: Defense-in-Depth Through Independent Verification

Ten roles verifying independently creates more confidence than coordinated sign-offs. Each role's unique lens catches different risks. No single point of verification failure.

### L267: Launch Countdown Verification ≠ Development Pause

The 10-cycle verification rotation was appropriate for T-0 Eve. Post-launch MUST return to normal development velocity immediately. Verification cycles should not become the norm.

### L268: Day 1 Protocol Pattern Emergence

Pre-launch naturally triggers "Day 1 Protocol" documentation across roles. Future major releases should explicitly schedule protocol creation 2-3 cycles before launch.

---

## Role Evolution Assessment

**No evolution needed.**

All 10 roles contributed meaningfully to verification. No coverage gaps, no overloaded roles. Team structure is appropriate for launch and Sprint 2.

---

## Recommendations for Next Cycles

1. **Ops (C552):** Execute T-0 — version bump, tag, npm publish
2. **All Roles (C552+):** Begin Day 1 operations per protocols
3. **Scrum (C561):** Sprint 2 kickoff retro + planning
4. **Memory:** Compression triggered (bank at 188 lines) — can happen post-launch

---

## Statistics

- **Cycles Covered:** 10 (C541-C550)
- **Learnings Added:** 3 (L266-L268)
- **Role Evolution:** None
- **Blockers:** None
- **Launch Status:** 🚀 **GO — LAUNCH WINDOW OPEN**
