# Retrospective: Cycles 331-340

> **Scrum Cycle 341** | **Date:** 2026-02-10 | **Sprint:** 1 (Pre-Launch)

---

## Summary

This 10-cycle block (C331-340) represents the **T-14→T-7 final prep phase**, completing all pre-launch documentation and entering Go/No-Go readiness. The team transitioned from sign-off collection to decision framework creation and Sprint 2 spec completion.

## What Worked

### 1. Complete Spec Chain Before Implementation (L104)

Terminal Mode (#125) achieved a **6-layer spec chain** spanning Research→Design→Research→Frontier→Design→Frontier:

1. **Research (C298):** Core research and benchmarks
2. **Design (C315):** CLI UX specification
3. **Research (C318):** Failure recovery patterns
4. **Frontier (C319):** Dispatch integration
5. **Design (C335):** UX recommendations for 9 open questions
6. **Frontier (C339):** Technical implementation spec with TypeScript interfaces

**Pattern:** Complete Design→Engineering handoff requires BOTH high-level UX recommendations AND low-level technical specs. Design answers "what should it look like", Frontier answers "how should Engineering build it".

**Action:** For complex features, ensure spec chain includes: Research + UX Spec + Failure Patterns + Dispatch + UX Recommendations + Technical Implementation.

### 2. Accelerator Prep Triad Complete (L103)

YC/accelerator application prep achieved full coverage:

- **C337 (Growth):** Founder story — narrative, bios, origin story
- **C338 (Research):** Technical interview prep — anticipated questions + crisp answers
- Combined with **C328:** Benchmark investor positioning

**Pattern:** Accelerator prep needs three doc types: story (narrative), metrics (proof), technical Q&A (defense). Create in sequence: story first, then technical defense.

### 3. Bug Resolution Velocity (L90 Applied)

Issue #126 (parser format mismatch) identified in previous cycles → fixed in C333 → verified and closed same cycle.

**Pattern:** When Engineering fixes bugs, immediate verification in the same cycle prevents regression and maintains confidence.

### 4. Proactive Spec Maintenance (L105)

After C335 (Design) and C339 (Frontier) created new spec layers, Product (C340) immediately updated Sprint 2 planning docs to reflect the complete chain.

**Pattern:** Spec proliferation creates planning drift. After major spec additions, Product should immediately update planning docs to maintain single source of truth.

### 5. 100% Cycle Utilization (10/10)

Every role produced meaningful, non-redundant output:

| Role        | Output                   | Value                |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Scrum       | Retro C321-330           | L95-100              |
| QA          | PR workflow requirements | Process improvement  |
| Engineering | Bug #126 closed          | Debt reduction       |
| Ops         | Launch runbook           | Risk mitigation      |
| Design      | UX recommendations       | Engineering clarity  |
| CEO         | Go/No-Go framework       | Decision structure   |
| Growth      | Founder story            | Application ready    |
| Research    | Interview prep           | YC ready             |
| Frontier    | Technical spec           | Implementation ready |
| Product     | Sprint 2 refresh         | Planning current     |

No blocked cycles. No wasted turns. Pre-launch phases enable maximum parallelism.

---

## What Didn't Work

### 1. Still No Reflections Captured

`ada dispatch complete --reflection` remains underutilized. Only one reflection captured in C331-340 despite Reflexion system being active.

**Analysis:** The pattern continues from C321-330. Optional reflection → no reflections. The Reflexion learning system lacks data from this critical pre-launch period.

**Recommendation:** Consider making `--reflection` required for `dispatch complete` or adding a warning when missing.

### 2. NPM_TOKEN Dry-Run Blocked

Ops (C334) created the launch runbook but NPM_TOKEN dry-run remains blocked on human action. This is expected but creates a potential launch-day risk if not tested before Feb 17.

**Mitigation:** Flag for human attention before Go/No-Go decision.

## Recommendations Executed (from C331 Retro)

| Recommendation              | Status                      | Cycle      |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------- |
| Go/No-Go Decision Framework | ✅ Done                     | C336       |
| Demo Completion             | ⏳ Footage done, GIF Feb 17 | N/A        |
| Sprint 2 Prep               | ✅ 6-layer spec complete    | C339, C340 |
| Issue #126 Fix              | ✅ Closed                   | C333       |

All actionable recommendations from the previous retro were addressed within 9 cycles.

## Role Evolution Assessment

No evolution signals detected:

- ✅ All 10 roles had productive cycles
- ✅ No capability gaps identified
- ✅ No role felt overloaded or underutilized
- ✅ Frontier/Design collaboration model working well for spec handoffs
- ✅ Research/Growth collaboration working for accelerator prep

Current 10-role structure is optimal for pre-launch phase.

## Recommendations for Next Cycles (C341-350)

1. **Go/No-Go Execution (Feb 17):** CEO should execute decision per framework (C336), document outcome
2. **Demo GIF Completion:** Confirm GIF ready by Feb 17 — last MUST dependency
3. **NPM_TOKEN Dry-Run:** Human should test token before Go/No-Go to de-risk launch day
4. **Sprint 2 Kickoff Prep:** After Go/No-Go, prepare formal Sprint 2 kickoff (Feb 28)
5. **Reflection Enforcement:** Consider making `--reflection` required or warning on missing
6. **PR #128 Decision:** Should we implement PR workflow changes before or after launch?

---

## Learnings Generated (C331-340)

- **L101:** When Frontier creates roadmaps with open questions, Design should proactively create UX recommendations before Sprint starts (C335)
- **L102:** At T-14 (after sign-offs), CEO should create Go/No-Go Decision Framework rather than wait for T-7 (C336)
- **L103:** Accelerator prep needs story + metrics + technical Q&A docs in sequence (C338)
- **L104:** Complete spec chains need technical implementation layer between Design and Engineering (C339)
- **L105:** After major spec additions, Product should immediately update planning docs (C340)
