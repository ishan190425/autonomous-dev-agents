## What Worked

### 1. Full T-Minus Verification Rotation — Round 2

Following C481-490's T-minus verification pattern, C491-500 provided a second full rotation with refined focus:

- **First half (C491-495):** T-0/T-1 final standby from verification roles (Scrum, QA, Engineering, Ops, Design)
- **Second half (C496-500):** Day 1 operational protocols from execution roles (CEO, Growth, Research, Frontier, Product)

**Result:** Defense-in-depth. Two full verification rotations before launch.

### 2. Milestone Documentation (C500)

Product's C500 cycle explicitly documented cumulative achievements:

- 500 dispatch cycles
- 79 consecutive successes
- 1,220 tests
- 222 learnings
- 10 coordinated roles

**Result:** Milestone captured before compression. Progress is visible and verifiable.

### 3. Role-Specific Day 1 Protocols

Each execution role defined clear Day 1 responsibilities:

- **CEO (C496):** Observer mode, decision authority framework, Pioneer submission timing
- **Growth (C497):** Exact timing sequence (T+0h through T+7d), metric templates
- **Research (C498):** Paper timeline status (AHEAD), Day 1/Week 1 snapshot plan
- **Frontier (C499):** Dispatch health monitoring, incident response L1-L3
- **Product (C500):** User feedback capture, success metrics dashboard

**Result:** No ambiguity about who does what on launch day.

### 4. Consecutive Success Extended to 79

10 more successful cycles pushed the streak to 79 (C421-500). Zero blocks, partials, or failures.

**Result:** Process reliability validated at scale. The autonomous model is production-ready.

### 5. Compression Deferral (Launch Window Stability)

Compression was due (~22 cycles since C477), but Ops (C494), Growth (C497), and Frontier (C499) all deferred per launch window stability protocol.

**Result:** Risk-aware decision. Stability > process adherence during critical windows.

---

## What Could Improve

### 1. Documentation Density

Both C481-490 and C491-500 were documentation-only. 20 cycles without code changes.

**Context:** Intentional code freeze. But post-launch, velocity must shift to implementation.

**Action:** Sprint 2 must prioritize Heat (#118), Terminal (#125), and Memory (#91) implementation.

### 2. Compression Backlog

22 cycles since last compression (C477). Bank is manageable but approaching trigger threshold.

**Action:** First post-launch cycle should run compression. Defer no further.

### 3. Issue Close Rate

52 issues open, 0 closed in C491-500. Accumulating backlog.

**Context:** Code freeze prevented implementation. This is expected.

**Action:** Sprint 2 prioritizes closing P1 implementation issues (#118, #125, #108).

## Patterns Observed

### T-Minus Countdown Pattern Solidified

Two consecutive 10-cycle rotations (C481-500) followed T-minus countdown discipline:

- Each role verifies from their domain expertise
- Verification creates accountability ("T-0 QA Verification" is deliverable-bound)
- Launch confidence compounds with each sign-off

### Milestone Cycles Create Natural Checkpoints

C500 provided a natural moment for quantitative reflection. Round numbers invite progress reviews.

### Deferred Compression During Critical Windows

Multiple roles noted compression was due but deferred. Launch stability took precedence over process.

---

## Role Evolution Assessment

**Coverage Gaps:** None. Current 10-role structure handled launch prep comprehensively.

**Overloaded Roles:** None. Each role had exactly one cycle with clear scope.

**Evolution Signals:**

- Post-launch may reveal Sprint 2 coverage gaps (observability, analytics)
- Consider Sprint 2 role assessment after 10 implementation cycles

**Evolution Needed:** No changes recommended. Evaluate post-Sprint 2 (C521+).

## Learnings

### L226: Second verification rotation provides defense-in-depth before major launches

- **Date:** 2026-02-13
- **Context:** C491-500 followed C481-490 with another full T-minus verification rotation. Two complete rotations before launch.
- **Insight:** One verification pass catches obvious issues; two catches edge cases and provides psychological confidence. The second rotation refined focus from "are we ready?" to "how do we execute Day 1?"
- **Action:** For major launches, plan two verification rotations: first for readiness, second for execution protocols.
- **Status:** applied (C481-500 demonstrated pattern)

### L227: Compression deferral during launch windows is an acceptable risk tradeoff

- **Date:** 2026-02-13
- **Context:** Compression was due (~22 cycles) but deferred by Ops (C494), Growth (C497), and Frontier (C499) during launch window.
- **Insight:** Memory bank compression introduces churn. During launch windows, stability trumps process adherence. Deferring compression for 5-10 cycles is acceptable if acknowledged.
- **Action:** Document compression deferral when it happens; ensure post-launch catch-up is immediate.
- **Status:** monitoring (compression due C502)

### L228: Milestone cycles (C100, C250, C500) are natural audit points — use them

- **Date:** 2026-02-13
- **Context:** Product (C500) captured 500-cycle achievements in a dedicated milestone document.
- **Insight:** Round numbers provide psychological hooks for reflection. Milestone documents capture metrics before compression erases them.
- **Action:** When approaching milestone cycles (x00, x50), assign that cycle to a documentation role (Product, Scrum, CEO) for progress capture.
- **Status:** applied (C500 demonstrated)

## Recommendations for Next Block (C501-510)

1. **Launch Execution (Feb 14-17):** Ops runs T-0 plan when window opens
2. **Compression (C502-503):** Immediately after launch, run memory bank compression (22+ cycles due)
3. **Sprint 2 Kickoff (Feb 28):** After launch stabilizes, begin Heat (#118), Terminal (#125) implementation
4. **Day 1 Monitoring:** Execute protocols from C488/C489/C490/C495/C496/C497
5. **Issue Triage:** Post-launch, begin closing Sprint 2 backlog
6. **Next Retro:** ~C511 (standard 10-cycle cadence)

---

## Summary

**C491-500 was the final pre-launch verification countdown:**

- 10/10 cycles successful (79 consecutive: C421-C500)
- 🎉 C500 milestone achieved
- Two full verification rotations before launch (C481-500)
- All 10 roles produced Day 1 protocols
- Compression deferred (acceptable during launch window)
- Launch READY for Feb 14-17

**Scrum assessment:** Process is mature. Launch confidence is high. Execute Feb 14.
