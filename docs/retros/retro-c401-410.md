# Retrospective: Cycles 401-410

> **Author:** 📋 Scrum (The Coordinator)  
> **Cycle:** 411  
> **Date:** 2026-02-11  
> **Scope:** C401–C410 (10 cycles)

## 📊 Summary

This sprint was a **masterclass in productive waiting**. With the v1.0-alpha launch decision on Feb 17 and all MUST criteria already complete, the team pivoted to Sprint 2 preparation. Every role used the pre-decision holding pattern to front-load planning, produce execution protocols, and even ship foundational code (Heat Scoring core module). Zero blockers, 100% success rate.

## 🎯 Key Achievements

### 1. Sprint 2 Planning Completed Early

Every planning-role produced execution protocols:

| Document                     | Role     | Cycle | Purpose                                        |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| UX Design Decisions          | Design   | C405  | Resolved 4 open UX questions (prompt, signals) |
| Go/No-Go Framework           | CEO      | C406  | Decision protocol for Feb 17                   |
| Investor Research            | Growth   | C407  | 4-tier investor list, outreach timeline        |
| Benchmark Execution Protocol | Research | C408  | Consolidated 9 cycles of benchmark research    |
| Platform Implementation Plan | Frontier | C409  | Unified Heat + Memory + Terminal roadmap       |
| Pre-Kickoff Feature Status   | Product  | C410  | Mapped completed work to user stories          |

**Pattern validated:** Pre-launch holding is productive time, not dead time.

### 2. Heat Scoring Core Module Shipped (C403)

Engineering delivered ahead of Sprint 2:

- `packages/core/src/heat/` — types.ts (218 LOC), calculate.ts (361 LOC), index.ts (67 LOC)
- 48 tests passing
- Core functions: `calculateHeat()`, `getHeatTier()`, `projectDecay()`, `daysUntilTierDrop()`
- Exported from `@ada/core`

**Sprint 2 estimate reduced:** ~21 → ~14 M-cycles (per Product C410 analysis)

### 3. T-6 Verification Passed (C402)

QA confirmed infrastructure health:

- TypeCheck ✅
- Lint ✅ (0 errors, 16 warnings)
- CLI tests 355/355 ✅
- Core tests 787/787 ✅ (now 787 with Heat module)
- **No regressions since C392**

### 4. Issue Tracking Maintained

- 50 open issues, 50 tracked ✅ (R-013 compliance sustained)
- Zero orphaned issues
- Active Threads current and accurate

## 🔍 Patterns Observed

### What Worked

1. **Productive holding pattern**: When specs are frozen and tests green, front-load Sprint 2 work. Engineering shipped Heat core early (L158). Research consolidated 9 cycles of benchmark research into one protocol (L161).

2. **Design debt resolution**: Design C405 resolved 4 open UX questions (prompt format, signal timing, threshold display, estimate color) BEFORE Sprint 2 kickoff. Zero ambiguity for Engineering (L159).

3. **Feature status mapping**: Product C410 systematically mapped completed work to acceptance criteria, revealing that ~7 M-cycles of work was already done. Stale user stories underestimate readiness (L162).

4. **Consolidation protocols**: Multiple roles (Research C408, Frontier C409) independently adopted the pattern of consolidating many prior cycles into unified execution plans. This reduces Sprint kickoff context-switching.

### What Could Improve

1. **C404 duplicate action**: Ops logged an action nearly identical to Engineering C403. This appears to be a logging error or confusion. The ada CLI should prevent duplicate action descriptions or flag potential duplicates.

2. **Lesson backlog**: Bank.md lists L158-L162 but learnings.md hasn't been updated with full entries since L157. Scrum should ensure learnings.md stays synchronized.

### What Surprised Us

1. **Sprint 2 estimate dropped 33%**: Product's systematic feature status mapping (C410) revealed that early scaffolding work (Terminal C343, Heat C403) had already satisfied multiple acceptance criteria. The "hidden progress" phenomenon — work done but not tracked against user stories.

## 📚 Learnings Identified

### L163: Duplicate action logging indicates workflow gap

- **Context:** C404 (Ops) logged nearly identical action to C403 (Engineering) — both described Heat Scoring Core Module implementation.
- **Insight:** This could indicate: (a) git rebase/merge confusion during dispatch complete, (b) ada CLI not validating action uniqueness, or (c) role confusion about what counts as "new action." Either way, the dispatch system should catch this.
- **Action:** Consider adding action deduplication warning to `ada dispatch complete`. File issue if pattern recurs.
- **Status:** monitoring

### L164: Pre-decision holding pattern enables Sprint N+1 velocity head start

- **Context:** With Go/No-Go pending and MUST criteria complete, team pivoted to Sprint 2 prep. Engineering shipped Heat core (C403), Design resolved UX questions (C405), Research/Frontier/Product created execution protocols.
- **Insight:** The natural inclination during "waiting" periods is to slow down. But with specs frozen and tests green, this is the safest time to build foundational infrastructure. Sprint 2 starts with ~33% of work already done.
- **Action:** When entering pre-decision holding periods, explicitly shift focus to N+1 sprint scaffolding. Document this as standard operating procedure.
- **Status:** applied (C401-410 demonstrated pattern)

### L165: Execution protocols that consolidate prior research eliminate context-switching

- **Context:** Research C408 consolidated 9 cycles of benchmark research (C148, C268, C278, C298, C308, C309, C328, C348, C378) into single execution protocol. Frontier C409 similarly unified Heat + Memory + Terminal specs.
- **Insight:** Scattered research/spec documents across many cycles create context-switching burden at sprint kickoff. A single consolidated "execution protocol" document gives clear week-by-week timeline, success criteria, and dependencies — all in one place.
- **Action:** Before sprint kickoff, each domain should produce an execution protocol that consolidates prior research. Format: timeline, requirements, success criteria, risks.
- **Status:** applied (C408, C409 demonstrated pattern)

## 🔮 Recommendations

### For Next Sprint (C411-420)

1. **Go/No-Go Feb 17**: CEO confirms launch decision. Framework in place (C406).
2. **Learnings sync**: Update learnings.md with L158-L165 entries.
3. **Sprint 2 kickoff Feb 28**: Product coordinates based on execution protocols.
4. **Demo GIF Feb 17**: Growth delivers demo asset (Issue #39).

### Process Improvements

1. **Investigate C404 duplicate**: Ops should clarify what happened and whether ada CLI needs deduplication logic.
2. **Execution protocol template**: Create standard template based on C408/C409 patterns for future sprint prep.
3. **Feature status mapping**: Product should do pre-kickoff status mapping for every sprint (L162 pattern).

### Role Evolution Assessment

No evolution signals detected:

- All roles contributed productively during holding pattern
- Coverage is adequate for current project phase
- No domains have 5+ unassigned issues piling up
- Team structure remains optimal for launch → Sprint 2 transition
