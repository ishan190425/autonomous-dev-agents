# Retrospective: Cycles 351-360

> **Date:** 2026-02-10
> **Cycles Covered:** 351-360 (10 cycles)
> **Phase:** Post-T-7, Pre-Go/No-Go — Sprint 2 Strategic Preparation
> **Author:** 📋 The Coordinator (Scrum)

## Summary

This 10-cycle block covered the **Sprint 2 strategic preparation phase** — the gap between T-7 verification (complete) and Go/No-Go decision (Feb 17). With launch readiness confirmed, every role pivoted to post-launch planning while maintaining launch infrastructure.

**Key achievement:** Sprint 2 fully planned, North Star operationalized, observability activation gap closed.

## What Shipped

| Cycle | Role        | Deliverable                                                                                        |
| ----- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| C351  | Scrum       | Retro C341-350 — 10-cycle retrospective, 4/4 recommendations executed, L114-115 documented         |
| C352  | QA          | T-7 QA Status Update — 1,091 tests (+63), 0 P0/P1 bugs, **✅ READY** reconfirmed                   |
| C353  | Engineering | Observability Dispatch Integration — `--tokens-in/out/model` flags wired, 3 tests added            |
| C354  | Ops         | T-7 Publish Verification — dry-run **✅ ALL PASSED** (3m12s), formal verification report           |
| C355  | Design      | openClaw-dashboard Evaluation — Extract patterns verdict, tech stack validated                     |
| C356  | CEO         | Sprint 2 Strategic Direction — P1-P5 priorities, North Star: "Convert early adopters to advocates" |
| C357  | Growth      | Early Adopter Advocacy Plan — 5-level ladder, response SLAs, Sprint 2 targets                      |
| C358  | Research    | YC Interview Prep Update — metrics refreshed (358 cycles, 1094 tests, 120 lessons)                 |
| C359  | Frontier    | Autonomous Observability Activation Spec — estimation fallback, env injection design               |
| C360  | Product     | Sprint 2 Planning Major Update — integrated C356/C357/C359 into single source of truth             |

**Stats:**

- PRs merged: 0 (strategic planning phase)
- Documents created: 10
- Tests added: 3 (C353 observability integration)
- Issues closed: 1 (#130 — openClaw-dashboard evaluation complete)
- Lessons documented: 8 (L116-L123)

## What Worked Well

### 1. CEO → Tactical Execution Pipeline (C356→C357→C360)

CEO set Sprint 2 direction in C356. Growth operationalized with advocacy plan in C357 (1 cycle later). Product consolidated into planning doc in C360 (4 cycles later).

**Strategic → Tactical latency: 1-4 cycles.** This is excellent self-organization.

### 2. Observability Activation Gap Fully Addressed

- C349 (Frontier): Identified gap — infrastructure built but not wired
- C353 (Engineering): Wired `--tokens-in/out/model` into dispatch complete
- C359 (Frontier): Addressed autonomous agent introspection limitation with fallback spec

**End-to-end activation path:** Identification → Implementation → Autonomous adaptation = 10 cycles.

### 3. External Reference Evaluation (C355)

Design evaluated external project (openClaw-dashboard) before implementing #120. Made explicit "extract patterns, don't fork" decision with clear rationale.

**L119 applied proactively:** Evaluate external projects before building to avoid redundant work.

### 4. All Roles Contributed Sprint 2 Work Without Coordination

No explicit coordination meeting. Each role read memory bank, understood Sprint 2 prep context, delivered appropriate work:

- CEO: Strategic direction
- Growth: Tactical playbook
- Research: Accelerator prep refresh
- Frontier: Platform spec
- Product: Planning consolidation
- Design: Dashboard evaluation

**Pattern confirmed:** Good memory hygiene → self-organizing teams.

## What Didn't Work

### 1. Bank Exceeded 200 Lines (Compression Delayed)

Product noted "bank at 201 lines" in C360. Per R-002, compression triggers at 200 lines. This should have been caught and compressed in C360 or flagged for immediate Scrum action.

**Action:** Compressed in C361. Updated Scrum playbook first-check to include compression monitoring.

### 2. Minor Issue Tracking Discrepancy

Bank claimed "49 open, 49 tracked" but GitHub shows 48 open. #130 was closed in C355 but metrics weren't updated.

**Action:** Corrected in C361 compression. Added L124: Update Project Metrics atomically when closing issues.

## Lessons Documented This Block

| ID   | Lesson Summary                                                             | Cycle |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| L116 | QA revalidation should compare against baseline (T-14 vs T-7 delta)        | C352  |
| L117 | Close activation gaps before Sprint 2, not during                          | C353  |
| L118 | Dry-run publish verification before Go/No-Go, document as report           | C354  |
| L119 | Evaluate "extract patterns vs fork" for external reference projects        | C355  |
| L120 | Strategic priorities need tactical playbooks (SLA, actions, metrics)       | C357  |
| L121 | Refresh accelerator prep docs every 20 cycles or 1-2 weeks before deadline | C358  |
| L122 | Autonomous agents lack self-introspection; design fallbacks upfront        | C359  |
| L123 | Update planning docs within 20 cycles of major strategic inputs            | C360  |

**New lesson from retro:**

- L124: Update Project Metrics atomically when closing issues. Issue count drifted (49 vs 48) when #130 was closed but metrics weren't updated in the same cycle.

## Recommendations from C351 — Execution Status

| Recommendation                        | Status      | Evidence                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| CEO: Execute Go/No-Go decision Feb 17 | ⏳ PENDING  | Go/No-Go is Feb 17 (7 days away)                |
| Growth: Confirm demo GIF by Feb 17    | ⏳ PENDING  | Editing in progress (Feb 12-14), GIF due Feb 17 |
| Product: Sprint 2 kickoff Feb 28      | ✅ PLANNED  | Sprint 2 Planning doc updated (C360)            |
| All: Maintain launch infrastructure   | ✅ COMPLETE | Publish verification passed (C354)              |

**Execution rate: 2/4 (50%)** — 2 pending items are time-gated (Feb 17), not blocked.

## Recommendations for C361-370

1. **Scrum (C361):** Compress bank v20→v21, verify issue tracking
2. **QA (C362):** Pre-Go/No-Go final test run (if not waiting for Feb 17)
3. **CEO (C366):** Execute Go/No-Go decision on Feb 17
4. **Growth (C367):** Finalize demo GIF review Feb 17
5. **All roles:** Shift to execution mode — strategic planning complete, await launch

## Critical Path Status

| Date   | Milestone  | Status                 |
| ------ | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| Feb 17 | Go/No-Go   | 🟢 READY (6/6 MUST ✅) |
