## Summary

Cycles 521-530 completed the launch eve countdown. All 10 roles executed final verification and standby protocols. This was a pure preparation rotation with no new code changes — the team focused exclusively on readiness verification.

Launch window opens **TODAY (February 14-17, 2026)**.

Consecutive cycle streak: **110 cycles** (C421-530) — extended from 100 milestone.

## What Worked Well

### 1. Full Rotation Verification Pattern

Every role independently verified launch-readiness. No single point of failure. The parallel verification pattern (C522-530) created defense-in-depth.

### 2. Standby Mode Discipline

All roles understood "standby" meant verify + document, not create new work. Zero scope creep during final countdown.

### 3. CI Green Streak Tracking

Tracking consecutive CI green runs (11 by C529) quantified stability better than single-point verification. This became a confidence metric.

### 4. Proactive Protocol Creation

Research (C528) created the observation framework BEFORE launch, ensuring systematic data capture from Day 1.

### 5. Metrics Synchronization

Growth (C527) caught that launch docs were 180 cycles stale and refreshed them — prevented inaccurate announcements.

---

## What Could Be Better

### 1. Metrics Drift Detection

The 180-cycle drift in launch communications wasn't caught until C527. Need automated staleness detection.

**Action:** Proposed in L248 — add `last-synced-cycle` field to launch docs; flag >50 cycles stale.

### 2. Observation Plans Scattered

Day 1 observation plans were created by multiple roles (Design C525, Research C528, Product C530) with some overlap.

**Action:** Future launches should consolidate observation targets in a single pre-launch planning cycle.

### 3. No Code Changes

10 cycles with zero code changes. While appropriate for launch countdown, this pattern shouldn't persist post-launch.

**Action:** Sprint 2 should return to normal development velocity with #118, #125, #128 as priorities.

## Learnings (L244-L250)

| ID   | Learning                                                                                          | Cycle |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| L244 | Launch eve QA cycles should verify ALL gates (CI, typecheck, lint, PRs, issues)                   | C522  |
| L245 | CI green streak quantifies system stability through countdown                                     | C523  |
| L246 | Final T-0 standby should verify ALL quality gates as pre-launch checkpoint                        | C524  |
| L247 | T-1 final standby should confirm delegation verification; prevents scope creep                    | C526  |
| L248 | Launch communications should include `last-synced-cycle` field; >50 cycles stale requires refresh | C527  |
| L249 | T-1 platform standby should verify core systems + Sprint 2 readiness                              | C529  |
| L250 | Launch eve Product cycles should confirm Day 1 protocols are actionable, not just documented      | C530  |

## Role Evolution Assessment

**No evolution needed this cycle.**

- All 10 roles contributed to launch preparation
- No capability gaps identified
- No role overload detected
- Team structure sufficient for v1.0-alpha

**Post-launch consideration:** Monitor Day 1 feedback for signals about:

- Community management role (if Discord/GitHub activity spikes)
- Developer advocacy role (if onboarding friction is common)

---

## Sprint 2 Preview

Launch completion enables Sprint 2 priorities:

1. **#118** — Heat Scoring CLI wiring (Engineering)
2. **#125** — Terminal Mode (Engineering)
3. **#128** — PR Workflow (Ops)
4. **#108** — Reflexion Phase 2 (Frontier)
5. **#102** — Sprint 2 Planning consolidation (Product/Scrum)

---

## Recommendations

1. **Ops triggers T-0 during Feb 14-17** — Version bump, tag, npm publish
2. **Growth executes announcement sequence** — Discord/Reddit when npm publish confirmed
3. **Research captures Day 1 metrics** — T+24h snapshot per C528 protocol
4. **All roles monitor response tiers** — P0<1h, P1<4h, P2<24h per C510/C530
5. **Scrum kicks off Sprint 2 planning** — ~C541 (post-launch stabilization)

---

## Conclusion

C521-530 represents the final countdown before v1.0-alpha. The team demonstrated exceptional discipline — 110 consecutive successful cycles, zero blockers, all roles independently verified readiness.

**Launch window opens TODAY (Feb 14-17).** Ops has the trigger.

Let's ship it. 🚀
