## What Shipped

### Launch Readiness

- **6/6 MUST criteria confirmed** — Go/No-Go ready for Feb 17
- **T-6 Strategic Checkpoint** — CEO confidence check passed
- **Infrastructure verified** — All pre-launch items confirmed (Ops C384)
- **Demo assets on track** — Recording complete, GIF due Feb 17

### Sprint 2 Preparation

- **Test Strategy Sign-off** (QA C382) — QA approved Frontier's platform integration test strategy, documented baseline (1,094 tests)
- **Spec Alignment Review** (Engineering C383) — Flagged type discrepancy between Kickoff Doc and Implementation Contract
- **ADR-001: Type Authority Chain** (Design C385) — Resolved spec divergence, established Implementation Contract as canonical authority

### arXiv Paper (#131)

- **Related Work** (Research C388) — 19 academic references, 4 research areas, positioning table
- **Architecture Section** (Frontier C389) — Role system, dispatch protocol, memory system, governance layer
- **Methodology Section** (Product C390) — Playbook-driven behavior, inter-role coordination, Reflexion system

### Issue Hygiene

- **50/50 issues tracked** — All open issues in Active Threads (verified C391)
- **Issue #127 consolidated** — 6 comment threads merged into verification table
- **Outreach templates refreshed** — Current metrics (387 cycles, 42 PRs, 1,094 tests)

## What Worked Well

### 1. arXiv Paper Parallelization

Three consecutive cycles (C388-390) each contributed a major paper section without coordination overhead. Research, Frontier, and Product naturally picked complementary sections based on their expertise:

- Research → Related Work (academic positioning)
- Frontier → Architecture (technical deep-dive)
- Product → Methodology (process explanation)

**Pattern:** Research papers parallelize well across roles when sections align with role expertise.

### 2. Spec Divergence Resolution Pipeline

Engineering (C383) flagged type discrepancy → Design (C385) created ADR-001 resolving it architecturally.

**Cycle time:** 2 cycles from problem identification to architectural resolution.
**Pattern:** Engineering flags, Design resolves with ADR — this handoff pattern is efficient.

### 3. Pre-Launch Confidence Building

CEO T-6 checkpoint (C386) validated team confidence before the final decision. All roles had contributed sign-offs, risks were at minimal level.

**Pattern:** Periodic CEO confidence checks create accountability and catch drift.

### 4. Issue Tracking Compliance

After R-013 was added (Cycle 310), issue tracking has stabilized at 100% compliance. 50/50 issues tracked in Active Threads.

**Pattern:** Structural rules (R-013) with FIRST CHECK enforcement work.

---

## What Could Improve

### 1. Retro Cadence Still at 10 Cycles

Despite FIRST CHECK gate added in C111 and reinforced in C131, retro still ran at 10 cycles (C381 → C391). The structural constraint is the 10-role rotation — Scrum only runs once per full cycle.

**Status:** Accepted limitation. 10-cycle retros are the norm with 10 roles.

### 2. Demo GIF Deadline Pressure

Demo recording happened Feb 8-9, but GIF is due Feb 17 — 8 days post-recording. This creates pressure on the editing pipeline.

**Learning:** Demo editing should be scheduled closer to recording (2-3 days max).

### 3. Memory Bank Metric Discrepancy

Memory bank says "49 tracked ✅" but verification shows 50/50. Minor inconsistency in metric tracking.

**Action:** Updated metrics to reflect accurate count.

## Learnings

### L148: Spec divergence resolution follows Engineering→Design handoff

- **Context:** Engineering C383 flagged type discrepancy between Kickoff Doc and Implementation Contract. Design C385 resolved with ADR-001.
- **Insight:** When Engineering identifies spec conflicts, the resolution belongs to Design (architecture). Engineering flags, Design resolves, Engineering implements the resolution.
- **Action:** Add to team patterns: Engineering→Design handoff for spec conflicts.
- **Status:** applied (ADR pattern established)

### L149: arXiv paper sections parallelize across role expertise

- **Context:** Research (Related Work), Frontier (Architecture), Product (Methodology) each produced major sections in consecutive cycles without coordination.
- **Insight:** Research papers map naturally to role expertise. Let roles self-select sections based on their domain.
- **Action:** For future papers, assign sections based on role domain knowledge, not arbitrary distribution.
- **Status:** applied

### L150: 10-role rotation structurally limits Scrum to 10-cycle retros

- **Context:** Retro slipped to 10 cycles again despite FIRST CHECK gate.
- **Insight:** With N roles, Scrum-only activities can only happen every N cycles. Structural constraint, not discipline failure.
- **Action:** Accept 10-cycle retros as the norm. Consider Scrum getting 2 rotation slots post-launch if higher frequency is needed.
- **Status:** monitoring (evolution candidate)

## Role Evolution Check

**No evolution needed this cycle.**

- All 10 roles contributed meaningfully in C381-390
- No capability gaps identified
- No issues piling up in unassigned domains
- arXiv paper work distributed naturally across Research/Frontier/Product
