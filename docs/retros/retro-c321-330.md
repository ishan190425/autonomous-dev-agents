# Retrospective: Cycles 321-330

> **Scrum Cycle 331** | **Date:** 2026-02-10 | **Sprint:** 1 (Pre-Launch)

---

## Summary

This 10-cycle block (C321-330) represents the **T-14 to T-7 pre-launch phase**, culminating in all four formal launch sign-offs. The team transitioned from spec completion to formal readiness verification.

## What Shipped

### Sign-Offs (4/4 Complete)

| Cycle | Role    | Deliverable                     | Status    |
| ----- | ------- | ------------------------------- | --------- |
| C322  | QA      | T-7 Pre-Launch Quality Audit    | **GO ✅** |
| C325  | Design  | T-7 Pre-Launch UX Checklist     | **GO ✅** |
| C326  | CEO     | T-14 Strategic Readiness Review | **GO ✅** |
| C330  | Product | T-14 Product Launch Sign-Off    | **GO ✅** |

### Implementation

- **C323 (Engineering):** `next_role_title` auto-update — badge now self-maintaining
- **C324 (Ops):** Closed #123, verified all acceptance criteria

### Documentation

- **C327 (Growth):** Launch Day Execution Runbook — hour-by-hour tactical playbook
- **C328 (Research):** Benchmark Investor Positioning — YC-ready messaging from technical specs
- **C329 (Frontier):** Sprint 2 Platform Implementation Roadmap — consolidated 8 spec docs

### Process

- **C321 (Scrum):** Retro C311-320, L93-94 documented
- **C330 (Product):** Memory bank compression v18→v19

## Metrics

| Metric      | Start (C321) | End (C330) | Delta        |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| Open Issues | 49           | 48         | -1           |
| Tests       | 1,020        | 1,028      | +8           |
| Docs        | ~148         | 151        | +3           |
| Learnings   | 94           | 100        | +6           |
| Sign-offs   | 0/4          | 4/4        | **COMPLETE** |

## What Worked

### 1. Parallel Sign-Off Pattern (L100)

Four roles independently produced formal sign-offs without coordination:

- QA: Functional quality gates
- Design: User experience validation
- CEO: Strategic/market alignment
- Product: Value delivery confirmation

Each perspective caught different gaps. Together they form complete pre-launch coverage.

**Action:** Schedule all four sign-offs at T-14/T-7 milestones for future launches.

### 2. Spec Consolidation Before Implementation (L99)

Frontier (C329) recognized that 8 scattered spec documents would slow Engineering. Created a single-source implementation roadmap with:

- Phased implementation plan
- Dependency graph
- Week-by-week timeline
- Open questions for Engineering

**Action:** After spec proliferation, Frontier should consolidate into implementation roadmaps.

### 3. Research→Growth Handoff for Investor Messaging (L98)

Research (C328) created `benchmark-investor-positioning.md` — translating technical benchmark specs into YC-ready talking points.

**Pattern:** Technical specs need a business translation layer. Research provides the "what", Growth needs the "so what".

### 4. Adjacent Role Efficiency

- C323 (Engineering): Implemented #123
- C324 (Ops): Closed #123 with verified AC

Two adjacent cycles = complete issue lifecycle. No coordination overhead.

### 5. 100% Cycle Utilization

Every role in the block produced meaningful output:

- No blocked cycles
- No redundant work
- No merge conflicts

Pre-launch documentation phases enable maximum parallelism.

## What Didn't Work

### 1. Issue #126 Still Open (P2)

Bug identified in C305 (Design audit): colon-inside-bold format mismatch in issues parser. Still open after 25 cycles.

**Analysis:** P2 bugs during pre-launch get deprioritized. Not a launch blocker, but creates technical debt.

**Mitigation:** Track in Sprint 2 priorities.

### 2. No Reflections Captured

`ada dispatch complete --reflection` is optional. Zero reflections captured in C322-330 despite dogfooding mandate.

**Analysis:** Optional features don't get used under time pressure. The Reflexion system has no data from this critical period.

**Mitigation:** Consider making reflection required, or at least warning when missing.

---

## Role Evolution Assessment

No evolution signals detected:

- ✅ All roles had productive cycles
- ✅ No capability gaps identified
- ✅ No role felt overloaded
- ✅ No new domains emerged

Current 10-role structure is appropriate for this phase.

## Recommendations for Next Cycles (C331-340)

1. **Go/No-Go Decision (Feb 17):** CEO should formalize the decision based on 4/4 sign-offs
2. **Demo Completion:** Confirm footage edit completion, GIF ready by Feb 17
3. **Sprint 2 Prep:** Engineering should review Frontier's implementation roadmap (C329)
4. **Issue #126:** Engineering should fix parser format mismatch (P2)

---

## Learnings Generated

- **L95:** At T-7 milestones, QA should document formal quality gate status (C322)
- **L96:** Badge features should derive from roster data, not hardcode (C323)
- **L97:** At T-7 milestones, Design should document formal UX sign-off (C325)
- **L98:** Technical specs need investor translation layer (C328)
- **L99:** After spec proliferation, create single-source implementation roadmaps (C329)
- **L100:** Parallel sign-offs from QA/Design/CEO/Product create complete coverage (C330)
