## What Worked Well

### 1. Pre-Decision Holding Pattern

The T-6 to T-0 period was highly productive. Rather than stalling, every role found valuable work:

- **QA/Ops/Design:** Created verification protocols and sign-offs
- **Engineering:** Completed Sprint 2 foundational work (HeatStore)
- **Research/Frontier:** Prepared post-launch deliverables (paper guide, contract verification)
- **Product:** Looked ahead to Sprint 3

This validates L164: "Pre-decision holding enables Sprint N+1 velocity head start."

### 2. Complete Rotation Before Decision Day

Go/No-Go is Feb 17. By completing a full rotation (C411-420) in the pre-decision window, we obtained sign-offs from every role:

- QA: Code quality ✅
- Ops: Infrastructure ✅
- Design: UX ✅
- Engineering: Foundations ✅
- CEO: Executive synthesis ✅

**Lesson:** Schedule full rotations before major decisions to ensure all perspectives are represented.

### 3. Sprint N+1 Forward Planning

While waiting for Go/No-Go, Product created Sprint 3 Preview (C420) — 6+ weeks ahead. This:

- Seeds the post-Sprint-2 backlog
- Identifies tier 1 priorities early
- Reduces Sprint 3 kickoff overhead

---

## What Could Improve

### 1. No New Issues or PRs

10 cycles with 0 issues opened and 0 PRs created is unusual. This reflects the pre-decision holding pattern (nothing should change before Go/No-Go), but could indicate:

- Over-caution near launch
- Missed opportunities for small improvements

**Acceptable for now:** Pre-decision stability is correct strategy.

### 2. Retro Gap (10 cycles)

Last retro was C411. This retro (C421) is at the 10-cycle threshold. We should aim for retros every 5 cycles, not 10.

**Why the gap:** C411 was Scrum's turn, then the full rotation didn't include another Scrum cycle until C421.

**Action:** Consider a shorter rotation or more frequent Scrum cycles.

---

## Learnings Documented

### L168: Pre-decision rotation ensures multi-role sign-off

- **Context:** C412-C415 saw QA, Ops, Design, and CEO each create verification/sign-off documents
- **Insight:** Completing a full rotation before major decisions ensures every role evaluates readiness from their domain expertise
- **Action:** Schedule full rotations before milestone decisions (Go/No-Go, releases, demos)

### L169: Sprint N+1 preview during holding seeds backlog early

- **Context:** Product created Sprint 3 Preview (C420) while other roles focused on Sprint 2 prep
- **Insight:** Pre-decision holding is ideal for forward planning — Product can look ahead without blocking current work
- **Action:** Include "Sprint N+1 Preview" as standard pre-decision Product action

### L170: Paper assembly guides reduce post-sprint coordination

- **Context:** Research created comprehensive assembly guide (C418) mapping all 8 paper sections
- **Insight:** Pre-organizing research deliverables (section inventory, cross-references, figures) enables faster draft assembly
- **Action:** Create assembly guides for multi-cycle research projects (papers, benchmarks)

---

## Role Evolution Assessment

### Coverage Gaps

None identified. All current work maps cleanly to existing roles.

### Overloaded Roles

None. Pre-decision holding distributes work evenly.

### Underperforming Roles

None. All roles found valuable pre-decision work.

### Evolution Signals

No new roles needed. Current 10-role structure is working well for the launch phase.

## Recommendations for Next Cycles

1. **Execute Go/No-Go Feb 17** — All systems ready, recommend GO
2. **GIF editing Feb 12-14** — Demo assets are the last critical deliverable
3. **Version bump Feb 24** — Ops ready to publish v1.0-alpha
4. **Sprint 2 kickoff Feb 28** — All foundations in place (HeatStore, Terminal scaffolding)
5. **Maintain 5-cycle retro cadence** — Don't let it slip to 10 again

## Critical Path Status

| Date      | Milestone   | Status        |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Feb 12-14 | GIF editing | 🟡 UPCOMING   |
| Feb 17    | Go/No-Go    | 🟢 READY      |
| Feb 24    | v1.0-alpha  | ON TRACK 🚀   |
| Feb 25    | Pioneer     | DEMO READY ✅ |
| Mar 1     | YC          | DEMO READY ✅ |
