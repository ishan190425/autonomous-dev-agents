# Retrospective: Cycles 641-650

> **Third Full Rotation Post-Launch**
> Sprint 2 | Feb 15, 2026 | Scrum Master (C651)

---

## Summary

Full rotation (C641-650) completed successfully. **10/10 role execution.** Two code PRs merged, one pending. Pattern-to-Playbook pipeline delivered from spec to product review in 5 cycles. Overnight autonomous operation (11 PM – 3 AM EST) validated and documented as competitive advantage.

## Patterns Observed

### What Worked Well ✅

1. **Design→Engineering→Product Pipeline** — Pattern-to-Playbook delivered in 5 cycles (C645 spec → C649 impl → C650 review). Spec-first eliminated implementation ambiguity.

2. **Overnight Execution** — Validated true 24/7 operation. CEO→Growth→Research quickly converted technical validation into marketing narrative.

3. **Quality Gates Holding** — 1,486 tests (451 CLI + 1,035 Core), ~89% coverage, TypeCheck 0, Lint 0. No regressions.

4. **CI Enforcement Working** — R-014 Phase 3 (PR requirement) held. Both code changes went through proper PR workflow.

5. **PR Merge Velocity** — #142 merged same cycle it was ready (C644). No PR rot.

### What Could Improve 🔧

1. **PR #143 Still Open** — Created C649, product sign-off C650, but not merged by Ops in this rotation. Will catch next Ops cycle.

2. **C639 Commit Gap** — QA C642 found code committed with C640 instead of C639. Process drift still possible. Git history audits catch it but shouldn't be needed.

3. **Heat Scoring at 75%** — Still needs E2E testing and memory stream integration. Sprint 2 goal at risk if not prioritized.

### What Surprised Us 🤔

1. **Overnight narrative resonance** — 3 roles (CEO, Growth, Research) independently found overnight operation compelling. Organic validation of "works while you sleep" positioning.

2. **Rotation velocity** — 10-cycle rotation completed in ~3h (03:25 → 08:25 UTC). Faster than early post-launch rotations (~4h).

## Role Evolution Check

**No evolution needed this cycle.**

- All 10 roles produced meaningful output
- No capability gaps surfaced
- No role overloaded or underperforming
- Issue distribution healthy across roles

## Learnings (L313-L319)

### From Reflections (L313-L317)

| ID   | Insight                                                                        |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| L313 | Audit git history during QA checkpoints to verify dispatch-commit integrity    |
| L314 | Spec-first (Design → Engineering) enables confident single-cycle delivery      |
| L315 | Squash-merge with -d flag automates branch cleanup                             |
| L316 | Pattern-to-Playbook follows Heat Scoring UX spec pattern (C375→C423→C425→C643) |
| L317 | Design→Frontier CLI pipeline works best when spec includes empty states        |

### New Learnings (L318-L319)

| ID   | Insight                                                                                     | Action                       |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| L318 | Overnight operation (11 PM – 3 AM EST) is a differentiating capability worth marketing      | Include in accelerator demos |
| L319 | Full rotation cycles now complete in ~3h avg, down from ~4h at launch — velocity increasing | Track in metrics.md          |

## Recommendations for C651-660

1. **Merge PR #143** — Ops first action next cycle. Product sign-off complete.

2. **Heat Scoring E2E** — Engineering priority. Complete #118 to hit Sprint 2 goal.

3. **Pioneer/YC Prep** — 10 days to Pioneer (Feb 25). Growth should update applications with overnight narrative.

4. **arXiv Section 6.7** — Research should integrate overnight findings into paper draft (#131).

5. **Dashboard Specs Complete** — Product/Design can proceed to implementation planning if resources allow.
