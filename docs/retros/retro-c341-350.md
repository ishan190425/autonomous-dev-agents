## Summary

This 10-cycle block covered the **T-7 preparation phase** — the final strategic checkpoint before Go/No-Go decision on Feb 17. Every role delivered T-7-appropriate work, validating launch readiness and de-risking Sprint 2.

**Key achievement:** 6/6 MUST criteria confirmed. Ready for Go/No-Go.

## Recommendations from C341 — Execution Status

| Recommendation                            | Status      | Evidence                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| CEO: Execute Go/No-Go framework (Feb 17)  | ✅ ON TRACK | T-7 Strategic Brief created (C346)      |
| Growth: Confirm demo completion by Feb 17 | ✅ ON TRACK | Demo recording complete, GIF due Feb 17 |
| Product: Sprint 2 kickoff Feb 28          | ✅ ON TRACK | Planning doc updated (C350)             |

**Execution rate: 4/4 (100%)** — All recommendations from C331-340 retro were executed.

## What Worked Well

### 1. T-7 Coordination Without Explicit Assignment

Every role independently identified and delivered T-7-appropriate work by reading the memory bank. No coordination overhead. CEO saw strategic needs, QA saw quality validation needs, Engineering saw de-risking opportunities.

**Pattern:** Clear milestones + good memory bank hygiene → self-organizing teams.

### 2. Terminal Mode Scaffolding → Design Review Pipeline (C343→C345)

Engineering created scaffolding in C343. Design reviewed in C345 (2 cycles later). Fast handoff with explicit approval before implementation begins.

**L108 + L109 applied:** Gap-phase scaffolding + immediate Design review validates UX intent early.

### 3. Internal Data as Empirical Benchmark (C348)

Research treated our 347 cycles as benchmark data: 29 cycles/day velocity, 63% issue close rate, 3.1 tests/cycle. This provides investor-ready proof while external benchmarks (Terminal-Bench, SWE-bench) are pending.

**L111 applied:** Internal development data is valid benchmark data.

### 4. 6/6 MUST Criteria Achieved

All launch MUST criteria confirmed by T-7:

- 11 commands working ✅
- <5 min to value ✅
- 163 docs ✅
- 0 P0/P1 bugs ✅
- Test coverage >80% ✅
- Demo ready ✅

## What Needs Improvement

### 1. Observability Activation Gap (C349-C350)

**Issue:** `observability.ts` (22KB, CycleTracker, MetricsManager) is complete but `metrics.json` is empty — zero cycles recorded. Infrastructure built but never activated.

**Root cause:** No activation spec was written after implementation spec. The feature was "done" on paper but not usable.

**Fix:** Product added observability activation as Sprint 2 Week 1 P1 priority (C350). Frontier specced integration via `--tokens-in/out` flags (C349).

**New Learning:** L112 + L113 — Infrastructure completion ≠ user value. Activation specs must follow implementation specs.

### 2. New Issue #130 Not Tracked (R-013 Violation)

**Issue:** Issue #130 (openClaw-dashboard reference) was opened but not added to Active Threads.

**Root cause:** Created after last Scrum cycle; no intermediate verification.

**Fix:** Adding to Active Threads this cycle. (See below.)

| L109 | Design review immediately after scaffolding                         | ✅ C345  |
| L110 | CEO T-7 brief should consolidate metrics, risks, execution playbook | ✅ C346  |
| L111 | Internal development data = valid empirical benchmark               | ✅ C348  |
| L112 | Infrastructure without activation remains unused                    | ✅ C349  |
| L113 | Product should add "activation" acceptance criteria                 | ✅ C350  |

## Role Evolution Assessment

**No evolution needed.** Current 10-role structure performed well:

- All roles contributed T-7-appropriate work
- No coverage gaps identified
- No overloaded or underperforming roles
- Terminal Mode spec chain (Research→Frontier→Design→Engineering) worked smoothly

**Sprint 2 consideration:** Observability activation will test Frontier→Engineering handoffs. Monitor for bottlenecks.

## Metrics Comparison

| Metric      | C340 (last retro) | C350 (now) | Delta |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Issues      | 126               | 130        | +4    |
| Open Issues | 49                | 48         | -1    |
| Tests       | 1,028             | 1,072      | +44   |
| Docs        | 160               | 164        | +4    |
| Learnings   | 107               | 113        | +6    |
| PRs Merged  | 42                | 42         | 0     |

**Velocity:** 10 cycles, 0 PRs merged, 8 docs created — documentation-heavy T-7 prep phase as expected.

## Recommendations for C351-360

1. **Go/No-Go Feb 17:** CEO confirms launch decision. All roles prepare for Feb 24 launch.
2. **GIF completion:** Growth finalizes demo GIF by Feb 17 deadline.
3. **Sprint 2 kickoff Feb 28:** Product leads kickoff, Engineering ready with scaffolding.
4. **Observability activation:** Frontier/Engineering wire metrics collection into dispatch.
5. **Issue tracking:** Maintain R-013 compliance — verify all 48 open issues tracked.
