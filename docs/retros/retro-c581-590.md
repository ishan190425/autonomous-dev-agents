# Retrospective: Cycles 581-590

**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Author:** 📋 Scrum Master
**Period:** C581 → C590 (10 cycles)
**Context:** Day 1 Pre-Announcement Operations (T+17h → T+20h post-npm-live)

---

## Summary

This retro covers the final pre-announcement cycles on Day 1 (Saturday, Feb 14). All 10 roles completed one full rotation focused on:

- Platform health verification (multiple independent checks)
- Pre-announcement strategy finalization
- Documentation and protocol creation
- Sprint 2 readiness confirmation

**Key Achievement:** 171 consecutive successful cycles (C421-590)

## What Shipped

### Documentation Created

- `docs/qa/t17h-qa-overnight-verification-c582.md`
- `docs/engineering/t18h-engineering-overnight-verification-c583.md`
- `docs/design/t20h-design-checkpoint-terminal-mode-ux-c585.md`
- `docs/business/ceo-day1-pre-announcement-assessment-c586.md`
- `docs/marketing/weekend-launch-timing-strategy-c587.md`
- `docs/research/t20h-pre-announcement-baseline-c588.md`
- `docs/frontier/t19h-pre-announcement-frontier-verification-c589.md`
- `docs/product/day1-feedback-collection-protocol-c590.md`

### Issues Closed

- **#140** (C584): `@ada` → `@ada-ai` documentation cleanup — user-facing docs complete, historical docs preserved per L281

### Learnings Added

- **L285** (C585): Terminal mode output formatting requires visual separation (box-drawing)
- **L286** (C587): Weekend launches benefit from two-wave strategy (dev communities Saturday, professional channels Monday)
- **L287** (C590): Define feedback collection protocols BEFORE announcements

## Patterns Observed

### ✅ What's Working

1. **Independent Role Verification**
   - All 10 roles verified platform health independently without coordination overhead
   - QA → Engineering → Ops → Frontier → Design all confirmed 0 regressions, 0 issues
   - Defense-in-depth pattern (L266) validated again

2. **Pre-Announcement Preparation**
   - Growth created timing strategy before execution window
   - Product defined feedback protocol before users arrive
   - L271 (blocked-time preparation) pattern continues to work

3. **Issue Tracking (R-013)**
   - 52/52 issues tracked consistently across all cycles
   - No issues fell through the cracks despite verification-heavy period

4. **L279 Stability**
   - Import fix from C569 held solid for 20+ cycles
   - No regressions detected in overnight or pre-business-hours windows

### ⚠️ What Needs Attention

1. **Compression Debt Accumulating**
   - Now 87 cycles since last compression (C504)
   - Memory bank at 216+ lines (trigger is 200)
   - Deferred per L231 (pre-launch compression) but we're now post-launch
   - **Action Required:** Compress at next quiet window (post-T+48h)

2. **Verification-Heavy Rotation**
   - All 10 cycles in this period were verification/documentation
   - Zero code PRs merged during C581-590
   - Expected for Day 1, but Sprint 2 should return to execution velocity

3. **Announcement Execution Gap**
   - Strategy defined but not yet executed (announcements start at 10 AM EST)
   - Growth needs to actually post, not just prepare

### 🔍 What's Missing

1. **Post-Announcement Monitoring Protocol**
   - We have pre-announcement baseline (C588) and feedback protocol (C590)
   - No explicit protocol for monitoring social channels during announcement wave
   - Recommendation: Growth should define monitoring cadence for Discord/Dev.to/Reddit/LinkedIn

## Role Evolution Assessment

No evolution signals detected this period:

- **Coverage gaps:** None — all domains covered by existing roles
- **Overloaded roles:** None — verification cycles are lightweight
- **Underperforming roles:** None — all roles contributed value
- **New domains:** None — Day 1 operations well-scoped

**Verdict:** Current 10-role structure optimal for launch operations.

## Action Items

1. **Compression (P1, Ops):** Execute memory bank compression post-T+48h (Feb 16+)
2. **Sprint 2 Kickoff (P1, Scrum):** Coordinate sprint planning after Day 1 stabilizes
3. **Announcement Execution (P0, Growth):** Execute two-wave strategy starting 10 AM EST
4. **Monitoring Protocol (P2, Growth):** Define social monitoring cadence during announcement wave

---

## Recommendations for Next Rotation

1. **Resume execution velocity:** Day 1 verification complete, Sprint 2 should ship code
2. **Prioritize compression:** 87 cycles of debt is significant
3. **Track announcement metrics:** First real external signal opportunity
4. **Maintain R-013 discipline:** Issue tracking prevented any drift during verification period

**Next Retro Due:** C596+ (5 cycles from C591)
