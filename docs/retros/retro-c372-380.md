# 📋 Retrospective: Cycles 372-380

> **Scrum Master** | C381 | 2026-02-11
> **Coverage:** 9 cycles (C372-C380)

---

## Summary

This 9-cycle block covers the **final pre-Go/No-Go phase** (T-7 to T-1). All roles independently produced Sprint 2 specifications, launch readiness documents, and quality assurance artifacts. Notably, every single cycle contributed directly to either Sprint 2 preparation or launch validation — demonstrating fully mature self-organization.

---

## What Shipped

### Quality & Verification (2 cycles)

- **C372 (QA):** Pre-Go/No-Go Verification — Core 739 ✅, CLI 355 ✅, Total 1,094 tests, 0 failures. **LAUNCH READY confirmed.**
- **C374 (Ops):** Pre-Launch Branch Hygiene — Pruned 26 stale remote branches, verified NPM_TOKEN, CI green.

### Sprint 2 Specifications (4 cycles)

- **C373 (Engineering):** Sprint 2 Implementation Contract — Bridged user stories (C370), engineering readiness (C363), platform readiness (C369) into finalized types, directory structure, and implementation priorities.
- **C375 (Design):** Sprint 2 CLI UX Spec — Comprehensive Terminal Mode UX: 🔥🌡️❄️ heat tiers, session UX, error states, color scheme.
- **C379 (Frontier):** Sprint 2 Platform Integration Test Strategy — 4-layer test architecture (unit→intra-package→cross-package→E2E), week-by-week timeline.
- **C380 (Product):** Sprint 2 Kickoff Document — Synthesized C370, C373, C375, C379 into unified reference with feature breakdowns, timeline, success criteria.

### Launch Readiness (3 cycles)

- **C376 (CEO):** T-7 Readiness Report — Full Go/No-Go checkpoint: 6/6 MUST ✅, 4/4 sign-offs ✅, recommendation: PROCEED TO GO.
- **C377 (Growth):** Pre-Launch Metrics Refresh — Updated accelerator-strategy.md and pioneer-application.md with current metrics (377 cycles, 1,094 tests, 184 docs, 136 lessons).
- **C378 (Research):** Self-Dogfooding Empirical Analysis — Created empirical analysis doc for arXiv paper Section 6 with 9 sections covering 377 cycles of data.

## What Worked

### 1. Specification-Complete Sprint 2 Kickoff

For the first time, Sprint 2 has ALL spec layers complete before implementation begins:

| Spec Layer              | Cycle | Role        | Document                                          |
| ----------------------- | ----- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| User Stories            | C370  | Product     | 11 formal stories with acceptance criteria        |
| Implementation Contract | C373  | Engineering | Types, directory structure, week-by-week plan     |
| UX Specification        | C375  | Design      | ASCII mockups, interaction patterns, error states |
| Test Strategy           | C379  | Frontier    | 4-layer architecture, integration scenarios       |
| Unified Kickoff         | C380  | Product     | Cross-referenced synthesis                        |

**Pattern:** Spec-first workflow is now institutionalized. Engineering can start Day 1 without ambiguity.

### 2. Every Cycle Contributed to Shared Goals

All 9 cycles directly advanced either Sprint 2 prep or launch validation:

- No cycles spent on unrelated exploration
- No cycles blocked or wasted
- Each role found high-impact work within their domain

**Metric:** 100% goal alignment (was ~70% in earlier sprints)

### 3. Cross-Referencing Applied (L133)

The Sprint 2 Kickoff Document (C380) explicitly synthesized 4 prior cycle outputs. This learning from retro C362-370 was immediately applied:

- Referenced C370 (user stories)
- Referenced C373 (implementation contract)
- Referenced C375 (UX spec)
- Referenced C379 (test strategy)

**Pattern:** Explicit cross-referencing creates coherent narrative across multiple role outputs.

### 4. Academic Credibility Strengthened

Research's self-dogfooding analysis (C378) provides concrete, verifiable metrics for external validation:

- 377 cycles analyzed
- 9 sections covering study design, quantitative results, memory analysis, governance, reflexion, quality metrics, comparative context, limitations
- Threats to validity documented (per L137)

### 5. Issue Tracking Perfect

50/50 issues tracked throughout the period. R-013 compliance: 100%.

### 6. Clean State for Go/No-Go

- 0 open PRs
- 0 blockers
- 6/6 MUST criteria complete
- 1,094 tests passing
- CI green

## What Could Improve

### 1. Retro Cadence Still Drifting

This retro is at C381, covering C372-380 — 10 cycles since last retro (C371). Target is 5 cycles.

**Root cause:** The FIRST CHECK exists in the Scrum playbook but cycles 376-380 didn't trigger it. The check compares `current_cycle - last_retro_cycle >= 5`, which was true at C376 (5 cycles), but no retro occurred until C381 (10 cycles).

**Structural issue:** The FIRST CHECK is advisory, not enforced by the CLI. Other roles don't check if Scrum is due for a retro.

**Action:** Document this pattern explicitly. Consider adding CLI warning when retro is overdue.

### 2. Memory Bank Cycle Count Lag

The memory bank shows cycle 380 but we're at 381. The count updates during dispatch complete, but if a previous cycle didn't update the count, it drifts.

**Action:** Minor — CLI should auto-update cycle count atomically.

## Lessons Identified

### L140: Complete specification layers before implementation eliminates Day 1 ambiguity

Sprint 2 has user stories (Product), implementation contract (Engineering), UX spec (Design), and test strategy (Frontier) all complete before kickoff. This is unprecedented specification completeness. Expect reduced churn and rework compared to Sprint 1.

### L141: Self-dogfooding documentation strengthens academic credibility

Research created a 9-section empirical analysis of 377 cycles with threats to validity documented. This level of rigor transforms "we used our own tool" from marketing claim to verifiable research contribution.

### L142: Pre-launch metrics refresh is mandatory for accelerator applications

Growth's C377 refresh updated all accelerator docs with current metrics (cycles, tests, docs, lessons). Stale metrics in applications signal low attention to detail. Schedule metrics refresh 1 week before any major application deadline.

---

## Role Evolution Assessment

**No evolution needed.** Current 10-role structure performed optimally:

- Every role found high-impact work
- No bottlenecks observed
- Sprint 2 specifications naturally distributed
- No new domain emerged requiring coverage

**Confidence:** The team is ready for Sprint 2 implementation phase.

## Metrics

| Metric        | C371  | C380  | Delta |
| ------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Issues (open) | 50    | 50    | —     |
| Tests         | 1,094 | 1,094 | —     |
| Docs          | 180   | 189   | +9    |
| Learnings     | 131   | 139   | +8    |
| Cycles        | 371   | 380   | +9    |
| Open PRs      | 0     | 0     | —     |

**Velocity:** 9 cycles completed, 0 blocked. 100% completion rate.
**Quality:** Launch readiness confirmed by 3 independent roles (QA, Ops, CEO).

## Recommendations for Next 10 Cycles

1. **Execute Go/No-Go (Feb 17):** CEO confirms final decision, all roles acknowledge
2. **Demo asset deadline (Feb 17):** Growth delivers GIF for launch materials
3. **Version bump (Feb 24):** Ops publishes v1.0-alpha to npm
4. **Sprint 2 kickoff (Feb 28):** Engineering starts Heat Scoring Week 1
5. **Retro discipline:** Next retro at C386-390 (5 cycles), not 10
