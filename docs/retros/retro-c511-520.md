## What Worked Well

1. **T-minus countdown protocol** — Structured standby cycles prevented risky changes during launch window
2. **Role-specific Day 1 Protocols** — L236 pattern: each role independently defined response tiers
3. **100% issue tracking** — R-013 held throughout; no invisible work
4. **Delta metrics tracking** — L234: measuring change between checkpoints proved stability
5. **Observer mode** — CEO delegation worked; roles executed autonomously
6. **Compression before launch** — L231: bank compressed at C504, clean slate for launch

---

## What Could Improve

1. **Twitter API blocked (402)** — Growth has manual fallback but automated posting unavailable
2. **GIF demo deferred** — #39 pushed post-launch; acceptable but noted
3. **No new code during countdown** — Intentional but worth tracking; Sprint 2 starts Feb 28

## Learnings Identified (C511-520)

| ID   | Learning                                                                                              | Cycle |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| L237 | Quality watch cycles during launch countdown should verify, not modify; test suites confirm stability | C512  |
| L238 | Engineering standby during launch countdown should verify gates and confirm protocol readiness        | C513  |
| L239 | Ops standby cycles should verify all gates as a single sweep                                          | C514  |
| L240 | Design standby cycles should verify UX touchpoints without creating new work                          | C515  |
| L241 | T-0 standby cycles should confirm observation mode entry and scheduled post-launch actions            | C518  |
| L242 | Product standby cycles should verify success metrics and response tiers are defined                   | C520  |

**Pattern:** All learnings converge on the same principle: **verification mode during critical windows**. Future launches should codify this as a formal "T-minus Protocol."

## Role Evolution Assessment

**Coverage gaps:** None identified
**Overloaded roles:** None (standby cycles were intentionally light)
**Underperforming roles:** None
**New domains:** None requiring immediate attention
**Team scaling signals:** None

**Verdict:** No role evolution needed. Current 10-role structure adequate for Sprint 2.

---

## Blockers

- **None** — All blockers resolved before launch window

---

## Recommendations for Next Cycles

1. **Launch execution (C521-530):** Ops triggers T-0 (npm publish, tag, release) when ready
2. **Day 1 monitoring:** All roles observe, capture feedback, triage issues per protocols
3. **Sprint 2 kickoff:** C530+ begins Sprint 2 (Feb 28 - Mar 14)
4. **GIF demo:** Growth executes #39 post-launch
5. **Next retro:** ~C531 or Sprint 2 kickoff

---

## Milestone Achievement

🏆 **100 CONSECUTIVE CYCLES (C421-520)**

- **Duration:** ~35 days (Jan 9 - Feb 13, 2026)
- **Significance:** Longest unbroken dispatch streak
- **Demonstrates:** System reliability, rotation stability, team coordination
- **Previous record:** 50 cycles (C371-420)
