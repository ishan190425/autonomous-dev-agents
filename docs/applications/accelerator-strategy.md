## Y Combinator Application

### Key Questions (Finalized Cycle 147)

**1. What does your company do?**

> ADA is an open-source CLI that creates autonomous AI dev teams for any repository. Multi-role agent teams — CEO, Product, Engineering, QA, Ops, Frontier — coordinate through shared memory, dispatch playbooks, and ship code without human oversight. We built ADA using ADA: 206 autonomous cycles, 34 PRs merged, 779 tests passing. Our launch sprint (Feb 24) was planned and executed entirely by our AI team.

**2. What's the insight or founder-market fit?**

> Current AI tools (Copilot, Cursor, Devin) are copilots — humans still integrate, test, and deploy. We realized multi-agent coordination (specialized roles + shared memory + dispatch cycles) enables true development autonomy. The key insight: AI teams need structure (playbooks, memory banks, rotation) just like human teams. As developers who spent years managing dev teams, we know the coordination problem intimately.

**3. What's your progress/traction?**

> - **206 autonomous dispatch cycles** completed (each cycle = one agent action)
> - **34 PRs merged** — 100% by agents, including architecture decisions
> - **779 tests passing** — CLI (256) + core library (523), including new MemoryStream module
> - **97 documentation files** — business strategy, product specs, engineering design
> - **8 memory bank compressions** — agents manage their own knowledge state
> - **Sprint 0 complete**: All 6/6 MUST criteria for launch ✅
> - **MemoryStream Phase 1 shipped**: Generative Agents-style cognitive memory in core library
> - **Discord community live**: discord.gg/5NCHGJAz — 16 days of community building before launch
> - **v1.0-alpha launching Feb 24, 2026**
> - **Demo video:** Recording Feb 8-9, showcasing end-to-end autonomous workflow
>
> Target: 500 npm downloads, 100 GitHub stars, 50 Discord members in first 30 days

**4. How do you make money?**

> Freemium model:
>
> - **Open Source (Free):** CLI, base roles (CEO, Engineering, etc.), local execution
> - **Pro ($30/mo):** Web dashboard, cloud execution, advanced observability (token/cost/latency tracking), custom role templates
> - **Enterprise ($500+/mo):** Custom roles, SSO, priority support, multi-repo orchestration, compliance features
>
> **Revenue projection:** $180K Year 1 → $1.2M Year 2 → $5M+ Year 3
>
> **Observability as differentiator:** No competitor tracks agent token usage, costs, and latency per cycle. Our Phase 2 observability features (launching before alpha) give teams real visibility into AI operations.

**5. How did you come up with the idea?**

> We were using AI coding tools and realized we'd become "copilot managers" — reviewing suggestions, integrating outputs, managing the meta-work of AI coordination. The tool was supposed to save time, but we were spending it differently, not saving it.
>
> We asked: what if AI could manage itself like a dev team? The key insight: human teams work through roles, playbooks, shared context, and structured handoffs. We applied that pattern to AI agents. The result: teams that don't just assist—they ship.

**6. What's your long-term vision?**

> Every software project has an autonomous AI team. ADA becomes the operating system for AI-native development — handling not just coding but strategy, quality, operations, and even its own evolution.
>
> We start with dev teams because that's where we have expertise, but the multi-agent coordination pattern applies to any domain: marketing teams, research teams, operations teams. ADA is the first proof point.
>
> The meta-story: ADA built itself through 186 cycles of autonomous development. By the time we launch, we'll have proven that AI teams can ship real products, not just generate code snippets.

**7. Why now?**

> Three convergences make this the moment:
>
> 1. **LLM reliability:** Claude 3.5+, GPT-4 can work independently with minimal oversight. Tool use is reliable. Context windows are large enough for meaningful memory.
> 2. **Cost curve:** LLM costs dropped 10x in 2 years, making autonomous agents economically viable for real development (not just demos).
> 3. **Market readiness:** 92% of developers use AI tools. They've experienced the "copilot tax" — the overhead of managing AI assistance. They're ready for the next step: AI that manages itself.
>
> Additionally: the infrastructure exists. GitHub Actions, npm workspaces, TypeScript tooling — all the pieces are in place for agent teams to operate in real repos.

**8. What's your unfair advantage?**

> - **Dogfooding proof:** We're the only AI dev tool built entirely by AI agents. 206 cycles, 34 PRs, 779 tests. Not a demo — a shipped product built by the product.
> - **Multi-agent IP:** No competitor has team-based coordination with memory persistence, role rotation, dispatch cycles, and self-compression. Devin is single-agent. Copilot is human-in-loop. We're n-agent autonomous.
> - **Category creation:** We're defining "AI Dev Teams" not competing in "AI coding assistants." Different TAM, different positioning, different outcome.
> - **Observability lead:** Built-in token tracking, cost analytics, and latency metrics. Teams can actually manage AI development costs — nobody else offers this.
> - **Open source network effects:** Template marketplace creates community lock-in. Custom roles become shared infrastructure.

### Video Demo Script (1-2 min for YC)

```
[0:00-0:10] Hook
"This PR was created, reviewed, and merged without a human touching the keyboard. 206 cycles later, we're about to launch. Let me show you how."

[0:10-0:30] Problem
"AI coding tools today are copilots. You're still reviewing, integrating, testing, deploying. You became the manager of your AI assistant. What if AI could handle the whole lifecycle?"

[0:30-0:55] Solution Demo
"ada init creates an agent team: CEO for strategy, Product for specs, Engineering for code, QA for tests, Ops for CI/CD. Each role has a playbook. ada run executes one dispatch cycle."

[Show terminal: npm install -g @ada/cli → ada init → ada run → PR created]

[0:55-1:15] Proof Point
"We've been using ADA to build ADA. 206 cycles. 34 PRs merged. 779 tests. Every architectural decision made by agents. The Sprint 1 Strategic Brief you're watching? Written by our AI CEO."

[Show GitHub: commit history, PR list, memory bank snippets]

[1:15-1:35] Business Model + Ask
"Open source CLI is free. Pro tier adds cloud dashboard, advanced observability, and cost tracking at $30/month. Enterprise for custom roles and compliance.

We're raising $1.5M pre-seed to scale the team and ship Pro.

This is what AI development looks like in 2026. ada.dev"

## Neo Application

### Key Differentiators for Neo

- **Early stage fit:** Pre-seed, pre-product-market-fit is their sweet spot
- **Technical founder:** Solo/small team building with AI assistance
- **Unique angle:** "I built my team before I hired my team"
- **Capital efficiency story:** 186 cycles of development, zero employee salaries

### Neo-Specific Talking Points

1. **Founder story:** Technical founder who built an AI team before hiring humans
2. **Speed:** 0 → shipped product in 206 cycles of autonomous development
3. **Capital efficiency:** AI agents are the first employees — they work 24/7, iterate in cycles, never leave
4. **Vision:** Every founder deserves a full team from day 1 — product, engineering, QA, even strategy

## Pioneer Application

### Why Pioneer First?

- Continuous enrollment (no batch deadlines)
- Quick feedback loop — tournament format gives fast signal
- Remote-first aligns with async AI teams
- Low commitment, good pitch validation
- $20K + community is bonus, not goal

### Pioneer-Specific Strategy

- Apply immediately post-launch (Feb 25)
- Use as validation of pitch resonance before YC submission
- Iterate based on tournament feedback
- Win the tournament = credibility + social proof for other applications
