## Y Combinator Application

### Key Questions (Prepare Answers)

**1. What does your company do?**

> ADA is an open-source CLI that creates autonomous AI dev teams for any repository. Multi-role agent teams — CEO, Product, Engineering, QA, Ops — that coordinate through shared memory and ship code without human oversight. We built ADA using ADA: 126+ autonomous cycles, 24 PRs merged, 443 tests.

**2. What's the insight or founder-market fit?**

> Current AI tools (Copilot, Cursor, Devin) are copilots — humans still integrate, test, and deploy. We saw that multi-agent coordination (specialized roles + shared memory) enables full autonomy. As developers who spent years managing dev teams, we know the coordination problem intimately.

**3. What's your progress/traction?**

> - 126 autonomous dispatch cycles completed
> - 24 PRs merged (all by agents)
> - 443 tests passing across packages
> - v1.0-alpha launching Feb 24, 2026
> - Demo: [link to GIF/video]
> - Target: 500 npm downloads, 100 stars in first 30 days

**4. How do you make money?**

> Freemium model:
>
> - **Open Source (Free):** CLI, basic roles, local execution
> - **Pro ($30/mo):** Web dashboard, cloud execution, analytics
> - **Enterprise ($500+/mo):** Custom roles, SSO, priority support
>
> Revenue projection: $180K Year 1 → $1.2M Year 2 → $5M+ Year 3

**5. How did you come up with the idea?**

> We were using AI coding tools and realized we'd become "copilot managers" — reviewing suggestions, integrating outputs, managing the meta-work. We asked: what if AI could manage itself like a dev team? The key insight was that multi-agent coordination (roles, playbooks, memory) mirrors how human teams work.

**6. What's your long-term vision?**

> Every software project has an autonomous AI team. ADA becomes the operating system for AI-native development — handling not just coding but strategy, quality, operations. We start with dev teams because that's where we have expertise, but the multi-agent pattern applies everywhere.

**7. Why now?**

> Three convergences:
>
> 1. **LLM reliability:** Claude 3.5+, GPT-4 can work independently with minimal oversight
> 2. **Cost curve:** LLM costs dropped 10x, making autonomous agents economically viable
> 3. **Market readiness:** 92% of developers use AI tools; they're ready for the next step

**8. What's your unfair advantage?**

> - **Dogfooding:** We're the only AI dev tool built entirely by AI agents — 126 cycles of proof
> - **Multi-agent IP:** No competitor has team-based coordination with memory persistence
> - **Category creation:** We're defining "AI Dev Teams" not competing in "AI coding assistants"
> - **Open source network effects:** Template marketplace creates community lock-in

### Video Demo Script (1-2 min for YC)

```
[0:00-0:10] Hook
"This PR was created, reviewed, and merged without a human touching the keyboard. Let me show you how."

[0:10-0:30] Problem
"AI coding tools today are copilots. You're still reviewing, integrating, testing, deploying. What if AI could handle the whole lifecycle?"

[0:30-0:50] Solution Demo
"ada init creates an agent team: CEO, Product, Engineering, QA, Ops. Each role has a playbook. ada run executes one dispatch cycle."

[Show terminal: npm install → ada init → ada run → PR created]

[0:50-1:10] Proof Point
"We've been using ADA to build ADA. 126 cycles. 24 PRs merged. Every architectural decision made by agents."

[Show GitHub: commit history, PR list, memory bank]

[1:10-1:30] Business Model + Ask
"Open source CLI is free. Pro tier adds cloud dashboard and analytics. We're raising $1.5M pre-seed to scale the team and ship Pro.

Want to see AI dev teams in action? ada.dev"

[End with logo + GitHub URL]

## Neo Application

### Key Differentiators for Neo

- **Early stage fit:** Pre-seed, pre-product-market-fit is their sweet spot
- **Technical founder:** Solo/small team building with AI assistance
- **Unique angle:** "I built my team before I hired my team"

### Neo-Specific Talking Points

1. **Founder story:** Technical founder who built an AI team before hiring humans
2. **Speed:** 0 → shipped product in 126 cycles (< 2 months)
3. **Capital efficiency:** AI agents are the first employees
4. **Vision:** Every founder deserves a full team from day 1

## Pioneer Application

### Why Pioneer First?

- Continuous enrollment (no batch deadlines)
- Quick feedback loop
- Remote-first aligns with async AI teams
- Low commitment, good signal test

### Pioneer-Specific Strategy

- Apply immediately post-launch (Feb 25)
- Use as validation of pitch resonance
- Iterate based on tournament feedback
- Low stakes, high learning
