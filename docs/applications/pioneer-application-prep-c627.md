# 🚀 Pioneer Application Preparation

> Quick-apply preparation for Pioneer accelerator — Feb 25 deadline
> **Author:** Growth (🚀 The Dealmaker)
> **Created:** 2026-02-14 (Cycle 627)
> **Status:** T+31h post-launch — READY FOR SUBMISSION
> **Deadline:** Feb 25, 2026 (11 days)

## Executive Summary

Pioneer is our first accelerator submission post-launch. It serves two purposes:

1. **Quick signal** — Tournament format gives fast feedback on pitch resonance
2. **Pitch validation** — Iterate before YC submission (Mar 1)

**Why Pioneer first:** Continuous enrollment, remote-first, low commitment, fast feedback loop.

## Pioneer Application Draft

### 1. What are you building?

> ADA (Autonomous Dev Agents) — an open-source CLI that creates autonomous AI dev teams for any repository. Multi-role agent teams coordinate through shared memory, dispatch playbooks, and ship code without human oversight.

### 2. What's the key insight?

> Current AI tools are copilots — humans still integrate, test, and deploy. The insight: AI teams need structure (playbooks, memory banks, rotation) just like human teams. Multi-agent coordination enables true development autonomy.

### 3. What's your progress?

> **v1.0.0-alpha LIVE on npm** (Feb 14, 2026)
>
> - 627 autonomous dispatch cycles
> - 206 consecutive cycles without interruption
> - 43 PRs merged — 100% by agents
> - 1,412 tests passing (89%+ coverage)
> - 369 documentation files
> - 297 lessons learned
>
> **The proof:** ADA built itself. Every PR, every test, every doc was created by our AI team.

### 4. What makes you unique?

> **Dogfooding proof:** We're the only AI dev tool built entirely by AI agents.
>
> **Multi-agent IP:** 10-role team coordination with memory persistence, role rotation, dispatch cycles, and self-compression. Devin is single-agent. Copilot is human-in-loop. We're n-agent autonomous.
>
> **Category creation:** We're defining "AI Dev Teams" not competing in "AI coding assistants."

### 5. What's your business model?

> Freemium SaaS:
>
> - **Free:** Open-source CLI, base roles
> - **Pro ($30/mo):** Web dashboard, cloud execution, observability
> - **Enterprise ($500+/mo):** Custom roles, SSO, multi-repo orchestration
>
> Target: $180K Year 1 → $1.2M Year 2 → $5M+ Year 3

### 6. What do you need?

> Validation and network access. We're raising $1.5M pre-seed for team scaling and Pro tier development. Pioneer tournament feedback will help refine our pitch for YC (Mar 1 deadline).
