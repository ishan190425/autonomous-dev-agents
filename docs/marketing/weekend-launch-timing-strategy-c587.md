> **Created:** 2026-02-14 06:49 EST (Cycle 587, Growth)
> **Context:** T+19h post-npm-live, Saturday Valentine's Day

---

## Situation

ADA v1.0.0-alpha went live Feb 14, 2026 12:35 EST (T+0). The announcement kit is ready but timing matters:

- **Current:** Saturday Feb 14, 6:49 AM EST
- **Holiday:** Valentine's Day (reduced professional engagement)
- **Weekend:** Lower traffic on professional platforms

## Channel Analysis

| Channel      | Weekend Traffic                    | Valentine's Day Impact | Recommendation                   |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Discord**  | High (devs always on)              | None                   | ✅ Execute 10 AM EST             |
| **Dev.to**   | Medium (tech crowd reads weekends) | Minimal                | ✅ Execute 12 PM EST             |
| **Reddit**   | High (r/programming busy Sat)      | Minimal                | ✅ Execute 2 PM EST              |
| **LinkedIn** | Very Low                           | High (personal focus)  | ⏳ Monday 10 AM EST              |
| **Twitter**  | Medium                             | Medium                 | ⏳ Monday (manual, human needed) |

## Recommended Sequence

### Saturday Feb 14 (Day 1)

| Time (EST) | Channel | Notes                                     |
| ---------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 10:00 AM   | Discord | Devs online, immediate community feedback |
| 12:00 PM   | Dev.to  | Tech audience, lunch break readers        |
| 2:00 PM    | Reddit  | Peak weekend traffic for r/programming    |

### Monday Feb 16 (Day 3)

| Time (EST) | Channel  | Notes                                    |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 10:00 AM   | LinkedIn | Professional audience returns            |
| 11:00 AM   | Twitter  | Manual (human), coordinate with LinkedIn |

## Strategic Rationale

**Why not wait for Monday for everything?**

- 2.5 days of silence post-launch loses momentum
- Developer communities (Discord, Reddit, Dev.to) are active on weekends
- Early community feedback helps refine messaging for professional channels

**Why not execute everything Saturday?**

- LinkedIn weekend reach is <30% of weekday
- Valentine's Day personal focus reduces professional engagement
- Better to sequence for maximum channel-specific impact

**Warmup Strategy:**
Weekend → Developer community (Discord, Dev.to, Reddit)
Monday → Professional network (LinkedIn, Twitter)

This creates two waves:

1. **Weekend (Feb 14-15):** Dev community buzz, GitHub stars, npm downloads
2. **Monday (Feb 16):** Professional amplification with weekend metrics to cite

## Metrics to Track

| Metric            | Target (Day 1) | Target (Day 3) |
| ----------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Discord reactions | 50+            | 100+           |
| Discord messages  | 10+            | 25+            |
| Dev.to views      | 100+           | 500+           |
| Reddit upvotes    | 50+            | 100+           |
| GitHub stars      | 15+            | 25+            |
| npm downloads     | 50+            | 150+           |

## Action Items

- [ ] 10:00 AM EST: Execute Discord announcement
- [ ] 12:00 PM EST: Publish Dev.to post
- [ ] 2:00 PM EST: Post to Reddit (r/programming, r/MachineLearning, r/LocalLLaMA)
- [ ] Monday 10 AM: LinkedIn post
- [ ] Monday 11 AM: Human posts Twitter thread

## Risk Assessment

| Risk                        | Probability | Mitigation                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Low weekend engagement      | Medium      | Dev communities are active; professional channels deferred |
| Valentine's Day distraction | Low         | Tech devs online regardless; LinkedIn deferred             |
| Negative feedback           | Low         | Monitor and respond within 4h per kit                      |
| Competitor announcement     | Very Low    | Weekend is quiet for launches                              |

## Decision

**Execute warmup strategy:**

- Saturday: Discord (10 AM), Dev.to (12 PM), Reddit (2 PM)
- Monday: LinkedIn (10 AM), Twitter (human)

This maximizes reach across both developer and professional audiences while respecting channel-specific optimal timing.
