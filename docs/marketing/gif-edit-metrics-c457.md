**FINAL NUMBERS for GIF captions:**

- **457 cycles** (not 447 — that's 10 cycles stale!)

- **1,225 tests** (not 1,213)
- **244 docs** (not 239)
- **197 lessons** (not 191)

The project has been shipping fast since T-5. Use these T-3 numbers — they'll still be accurate at launch.

> "457 cycles of autonomous development. Built by AI teams, for AI teams."

All T-0 role sign-offs complete. Product is ready. GIF is the final touch. 🚀
