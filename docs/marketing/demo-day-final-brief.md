## 🎯 Strategic Talking Points

### Define the Category (from CEO Brief)

> "Today's AI tools are copilots. Cursor suggests code — you review it. ChatGPT writes a function — you integrate it. You're still the bottleneck.
>
> ADA is different. It's an autonomous TEAM: CEO, Product, Engineering, QA, Ops — all coordinating through shared memory."

### The Proof Point (from CEO Brief)

> "We're not promising to replace your team. We're proving AI teams are possible — by being one."

### Competitive Differentiation (from Research Brief)

| Objection               | Response                                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Devin does this"       | Devin is one agent pretending to be a team. ADA is 10 specialized roles with persistent memory. |
| "Claude Code has teams" | Claude Code offers features. ADA is a complete team product with role rotation.                 |
| "Why not CrewAI?"       | CrewAI is a framework. ADA is a ready-to-run team — one command, full team.                     |

## 📝 Updated Script (2 Minutes)

### [0:00-0:15] HOOK

> "What if AI could run your entire dev team? Not just write code — but plan features, review PRs, and ship while you sleep. That's ADA: Autonomous Dev Agents."

### [0:15-0:30] PROBLEM

> "AI tools today are copilots. You're still the bottleneck — reviewing, integrating, context-switching. What if AI could handle the whole workflow?"

### [0:30-1:30] DEMO FLOW

**Scene 1: Project Setup**

```bash
cd ada-demo-project
ada init
```

> "One command. ADA creates a full agent team — 10 specialized roles with playbooks and shared memory."

**Scene 2: Dispatch**

```bash
ada run
```

> "The agent reads context, checks the memory bank, picks an action, executes. One autonomous cycle — issue created, memory updated, role rotated."

**Scene 3: Status**

```bash
ada status
```

> "See where you are. Current role, cycle count, memory health. Run again, the next role acts. Then the next. Autonomous progress."

**Scene 4: The Magic**

> "This creates real issues, real PRs, real progress — while you focus on what matters."

### [1:30-1:45] DOGFOODING (Updated Numbers — Cycle 187)

> "The wild part? We built ADA with ADA. **186 autonomous cycles. 32 PRs merged. 676 tests passing.** Every architecture decision made by AI agents coordinating through GitHub. This isn't a demo. It's real."

### [1:45-2:00] CTA

> "npm install -g @ada/cli. Star us on GitHub. ADA dot dev."

## ✅ Recording Day Checklist

### Morning Prep (10:00 AM)

- [ ] Terminal: `export PS1='$ '` | 18pt font | Dracula theme | 100×30
- [ ] Demo repo: `cd ~/RIA/ada-demo-project && rm -rf agents/ && git checkout -- .`
- [ ] Verify: `ada --version` → 0.1.0
- [ ] Quiet room, notifications off

### Recording Order

1. **GIF (30s)** — Twitter/GitHub, required
2. **Video (2m)** — Full narration, stretch goal

### Fallback

- API issues? Use `ada run --dry-run`
- Time short? GIF alone meets Go/No-Go criteria

## 💡 CEO Directives (from Strategic Brief)

1. **Lead with proof, not promises.** Show real commits, real PRs, real memory bank.
2. **Define the category clearly.** "Autonomous team, not coding assistant" — say it twice.
3. **Show the memory.** Open bank.md on camera. It's our differentiator.
4. **Be honest about limitations.** "This is v1.0-alpha. It's not perfect. But it's real."
5. **Close with one clear ask.** Star on GitHub OR npm install. Pick one.
