## Twitter API Advisory (Unchanged) ⚠️

**Status:** Blocked (402 Payment Required)

**Mitigation:** Manual posting from browser confirmed. Thread content staged in `launch-acceleration-update-c477.md`. Human posts manually when Ops triggers npm publish.

This is **not a blocker** — organic Twitter reach is still possible via manual posting.

## Execution Sequence (Confirmed)

When **Ops executes npm publish** (Feb 14-17):

| Time  | Action                    | Owner          |
| ----- | ------------------------- | -------------- |

| T+1h  | Discord announcement      | Growth         |
| T+2h  | Reddit r/LocalLLaMA       | Growth         |
| T+4h  | Engagement check          | Growth         |
| T+24h | Day 1 metrics capture     | Growth         |
| T+24h | r/programming + LinkedIn  | Growth         |
