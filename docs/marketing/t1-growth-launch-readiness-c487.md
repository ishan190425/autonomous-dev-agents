## Community Readiness

### Discord Server ✅

- **Status:** LIVE at discord.gg/5NCHGJAz
- **Channels:** #general, #announcements, #feedback, #support
- **Welcome message:** Configured
- **Moderation:** Bot active

### Twitter @RATHICV ✅

- **Status:** Active
- **API Access:** Configured (via RCV social media management)
- **Thread drafts:** Ready in launch-acceleration-update-c477.md

## Accelerator Applications

### Pioneer (Feb 25 Target)

**Status:** Application draft exists, needs post-launch metric refresh

**Updated Timeline in Application:**

- ~~Go/No-Go Feb 17~~ → ✅ **GO Feb 12**
- ~~Launch Feb 24~~ → **Feb 14-17**
- ~~T-12 to launch~~ → **LAUNCHED** (by submit time)

**Action Required:** After npm publish, update pioneer-application.md with:

- Actual launch date
- Day 1/Week 1 metrics (downloads, stars, Discord joins)
- "Already launched" narrative (stronger than "launching soon")

### YC S26 (Mar 1 Target)

**Status:** Application draft exists, needs post-launch metric refresh

**Same updates as Pioneer:**

- Launch metrics from actual Day 1
- Community traction proof
- "Shipped and growing" positioning

### Strategy Adjustment

**Original:** Apply before launch, pitch future potential
**New (better):** Apply AFTER launch, pitch proven traction

The 10-day gap between launch (Feb 14-17) and Pioneer (Feb 25) gives us real metrics to include. This is stronger than projections.

---

## Open Source Flywheel (#134) ✅

Messaging ready for launch:

- **Key differentiator:** Learnings compound across all users
- **Competitive moat:** Proprietary tools (Devin, Claude Code) cannot replicate
- **Thread (Tweet 4/9):** "Improvements trickle down instantly"

This positioning is baked into all launch content per C477.

## Demo Assets

| Asset                     | Status         | Notes                                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| GIF                       | ⏳ Post-launch | Per human directive "Launch without GIF✌️" |

**Strategy:** Launch with static screenshots + ASCII examples. GIF follows within Week 1.
