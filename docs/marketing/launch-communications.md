## Launch Narrative

### Core Story

> _"We built an autonomous AI dev team framework. Then we used it to build itself."_

ADA isn't just a product — it's a demonstration. Every PR merged, every issue created, every architectural decision in this repository was made by AI agents working autonomously in coordinated roles. The dogfooding story IS the differentiation.

### Key Metrics (Updated Cycle 307 — Pre-Edit)

| Metric                     | Value   | Notes                                    |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Autonomous dispatch cycles | **307** | Each cycle = one agent action            |
| PRs merged                 | **42**  | 100% agent-authored                      |

### Twitter/X Launch Thread

```
🧵 Thread: Introducing ADA — Autonomous AI Dev Teams (1/9)

We just shipped something wild: an open-source framework for autonomous AI dev teams.

Not copilots. Full teams — with CEO, Product, Engineering, QA, Ops, Research, and more.

Here's why we built it 👇
```

```
(2/9) The problem with AI coding tools today:

You're still the bottleneck.

Copilot suggests code → you review
ChatGPT writes a function → you integrate
Claude builds a feature → you test and deploy

What if AI could handle the WHOLE workflow?
```

```
(3/9) Enter ADA:

A CLI that creates multi-role AI agent teams for your repo.

• 👔 CEO — Strategy & direction
• 📦 Product — Features & specs
• ⚙️ Engineering — Code & PRs
• 🔍 QA — Testing & quality
• 🛡️ Ops — CI/CD & standards
• 🌌 Frontier — Platform & innovation

Each role has a playbook. They coordinate through memory.
```

```
(4/9) The weird part?

We've been building ADA with ADA.

307 autonomous dispatch cycles
42 PRs merged to main
986 passing tests
0 human commits (except initial setup)

Every issue, decision, and line of code was written by agents.
```

```
(5/9) How it works:

npm install -g @ada/cli
cd your-repo
ada init
ada dispatch start
# ... agent does work ...
ada dispatch complete

That's it. Agents create issues, write code, merge PRs, and evolve the codebase.
```

```
(6/9) Why multi-agent > single-agent?

Same reason companies have roles instead of one person doing everything:

• Specialization → better outputs
• Coordination → parallel progress
• Memory → context persists across sessions
• Accountability → each role owns their domain
```

```
(7/9) It's not just coordination — it's cognition.

ADA agents have Generative Agents-style memory:
- Recency × importance × relevance scoring
- Semantic search with embeddings
- Automatic memory compression

They don't just execute — they remember and learn.
```

```
(8/9) What you can build:

• Open-source projects that maintain themselves
• Side projects that ship while you sleep
• Startup MVPs with minimal human oversight
• Internal tools with automated evolution

We're starting with dev teams. The pattern works for anything.
```

```
(9/9) v1.0-alpha is out NOW:

🔗 GitHub: github.com/ishan190425/autonomous-dev-agents
📦 npm: @ada/cli
🎮 Discord: discord.gg/5NCHGJAz

Try it. Break it. Tell us what sucks.

We're building the future of software development.

And we're doing it in public. 🚀
```

### Reddit Post (r/programming)

**Title:** We built an open-source framework for autonomous AI dev teams — 297 cycles of agents building themselves

```

**TL;DR:** ADA is a CLI tool that creates multi-role AI agent teams for your repo. We've been dogfooding it since day one — 307 autonomous cycles, 42 PRs merged, 986 tests, zero human commits.

---

**The Problem**

Every AI coding tool today still requires humans in the loop:

- Copilot suggests → you review
- ChatGPT writes → you integrate
- Claude codes → you test and deploy

You're not a developer anymore. You're a copilot manager.

**Our Approach**

What if AI could coordinate like a team? Multiple specialized agents with:

- Defined roles (CEO, Product, Engineering, QA, Ops, Research, Frontier)
- Written playbooks (what actions they can take)
- Cognitive memory (Generative Agents-style semantic recall)
- GitHub as communication layer (issues, PRs, comments)

**How It Works**

```bash
npm install -g @ada/cli
cd your-repo
ada init          # Creates agents/ folder with team config
ada run           # Executes one dispatch cycle
ada dispatch start/complete  # Full lifecycle control
```

**What We Learned Dogfooding (297 cycles)**

1. **Roles need constraints** — Without playbooks, agents go off-script
2. **Memory is everything** — Shared memory bank prevents repeated work
3. **Evolution happens** — QA and Frontier roles didn't exist at launch — agents proposed them
4. **Compression matters** — Memory banks grow fast. We added automatic archiving at 200 lines
5. **Semantic search is key** — Agents need to recall by meaning, not keywords (we implemented embeddings)

**Technical Details**

- TypeScript monorepo (npm workspaces)
- Commander.js CLI
- LLM-agnostic (bring your own model)
- 986 tests (Vitest)
- Cognitive memory with TF-IDF + semantic embeddings
- Trunk-based development

**Try It**

GitHub: github.com/ishan190425/autonomous-dev-agents
npm: @ada/cli
Discord: discord.gg/5NCHGJAz

This is v1.0-alpha. Expect rough edges. We're iterating fast.

Questions? AMA in comments.

### Hacker News "Show HN" (T+7)

**Title:** Show HN: ADA – Open-source framework for autonomous AI dev teams (307 cycles of self-development)

```

ADA creates multi-role AI agent teams that handle your full development lifecycle. Think: automated CEO, Product, Engineering, QA, Ops — coordinating through shared memory, playbooks, and GitHub primitives.

We've been dogfooding it to build itself:

- 307 autonomous dispatch cycles
- 42 PRs merged by agents
- 986 tests written by agents
- Zero human commits (except bootstrap)

The key insights:

1. Multi-agent coordination > single powerful agent
2. Agents need memory (we implemented Generative Agents-style semantic recall)
3. Role rotation + playbooks = structured autonomy
4. GitHub issues/PRs are natural coordination primitives

Tech: TypeScript, Commander.js CLI, LLM-agnostic, npm workspaces monorepo.

Try it:
npm install -g @ada/cli && ada init && ada run

GitHub: https://github.com/ishan190425/autonomous-dev-agents
Discord: https://discord.gg/5NCHGJAz

We're iterating fast on v1.0-alpha. Would love feedback on:

1. What's missing from the role system?
2. How would you customize playbooks for your projects?
3. What observability do you need for AI dev costs?

```

### Product Hunt Tagline Options

1. "Ship software with autonomous AI dev teams — 307 cycles of self-development"
2. "Multi-role AI agents that handle your full dev lifecycle"
3. "The AI dev team that built itself — now build your own"
4. "Stop managing copilots. Deploy dev teams."

### LinkedIn Announcement (CEO Post)

```

🚀 Announcing ADA: Autonomous AI Dev Teams

Today we're releasing ADA — an open-source framework for creating multi-role AI agent teams on any software project.

The premise is simple: AI tools today are copilots. You're still the pilot. What if AI could be the whole crew?

ADA creates teams with specialized roles (CEO, Product, Engineering, QA, Ops, Research, Frontier) that coordinate through cognitive memory, role-specific playbooks, and structured dispatch cycles.

**The proof:**

We've been using ADA to build ADA since cycle 1.

• 307 autonomous dispatch cycles
• 42 pull requests merged
• 986 passing tests
• Every architectural decision made by agents

The agents proposed new roles (QA, Frontier). They designed the memory system. They wrote the dispatch protocol. They shipped cognitive memory with semantic search.

This isn't theoretical — it's a working, shipping product built by AI teams.

v1.0-alpha is available now:
🔗 GitHub: github.com/ishan190425/autonomous-dev-agents
📦 npm: @ada/cli
🎮 Discord: discord.gg/5NCHGJAz

If you're interested in the future of software development, I'd love to connect.

**Outreach Template:**

```

Subject: Thought you might find this interesting — autonomous AI dev teams

Hey [Name],

I saw your recent [post/video/thread] about [topic] and thought you might be interested in something we just shipped.

We built an open-source framework called ADA for creating multi-role AI agent teams. The weird part: we've been using it to build itself — 247 autonomous cycles, 39 PRs merged, zero human commits.

The agents have cognitive memory with semantic search, role rotation, and they even proposed new roles for themselves (QA and Frontier weren't in the original design).

Not asking for a review or anything — just thought it might spark some ideas given your work on [relevant topic].

Repo: github.com/ishan190425/autonomous-dev-agents

**Do:**
- Use specific numbers ("247 cycles" not "many cycles")
- Acknowledge limitations openly
- Reference the dogfooding story as proof
- Ask for feedback genuinely
- Highlight cognitive memory as differentiator

**Don't:**
- Overclaim ("revolutionary", "game-changing")
- Hide behind jargon
- Dismiss criticism
- Over-explain technical details in general audiences
