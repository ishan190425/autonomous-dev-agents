## Channel Strategy

### Primary Channels (High ROI, Own the Platform)

| Channel       | Purpose                        | Target Metric       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| **GitHub**    | Discovery, trust, contribution | 500 stars by Apr    |
| **npm**       | Distribution, credibility      | 1K downloads by Apr |
| **Twitter/X** | Announcements, community       | 1K followers by Apr |
| **Discord**   | Support, feedback, community   | 100 members by Apr  |

### Secondary Channels (Amplification)

| Channel         | Purpose                       | Frequency                                  |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Hacker News** | Launch spike, credibility     | 1x major, 2x comments/month                |
| **Reddit**      | Niche communities             | 2x/month (r/LocalLLaMA, r/MachineLearning) |
| **Dev.to**      | SEO, technical audience       | 2x/month                                   |

### Avoid (Low ROI for Alpha)

- Paid ads (no budget, wrong stage)
- Product Hunt (save for Pro launch)
- Press releases (no story yet)
- Influencer partnerships (premature)

## Messaging Framework

### Tagline Options (A/B Test)

| Version | Tagline                                  |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| A       | "Ship software with autonomous AI teams" |
| B       | "AI dev teams that actually ship"        |
| C       | "Your repo, your agents, your velocity"  |

**Recommended:** Version A — Clear, benefit-focused, differentiated

### Key Messages

**For Developers:**

> "ADA gives your repo a full dev team — CEO, engineer, QA, ops — all AI, all autonomous. Run `ada init`, then `ada run`, and watch agents create issues, write code, and ship PRs."

**For Technical Leaders:**

> "Stop context-switching. ADA's multi-agent system handles the full development lifecycle — from planning to deployment. Configurable, auditable, and built for your workflow."

**For Skeptics:**

> "We built ADA with ADA. 97 autonomous cycles. 19 PRs merged. Every decision made by agents. See the commit history."

### Proof Points

1. **Dogfooding:** "ADA built itself" — 97 cycles, 19 PRs
2. **Multi-agent innovation:** "7 specialized roles, not one generic copilot"
3. **Developer-first:** "CLI tool, works with any repo, no lock-in"
4. **Open source:** "MIT license, see every line of code"

## Competitive Positioning

### Landscape

| Competitor        | What They Do     | Our Differentiation                         |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| GitHub Copilot    | Code completion  | We do full lifecycle, not just autocomplete |
| Cursor            | AI-powered IDE   | We're multi-agent teams, not enhanced IDE   |
| Devin (Cognition) | Autonomous coder | We're open source, multi-role, transparent  |
| AutoGPT/AgentGPT  | General agents   | We're purpose-built for development         |
| SWE-Agent         | Code agent       | We have team dynamics, memory, rotation     |

### Our Wedge

**"The only open-source multi-agent development framework that runs autonomously on your repo."**

- Not a copilot → Autonomous
- Not one agent → Team of specialists
- Not closed → Open source, MIT
- Not generic → Built for development
