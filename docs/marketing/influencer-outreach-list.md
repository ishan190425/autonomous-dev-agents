## Outreach Templates

### Tier 1 Template (Personalized)

```
Subject: Quick look at something you might find interesting

Hey [First Name],

Saw your recent [specific post/thread/video about topic]. Thought this might spark some ideas.

We built an open-source framework for autonomous AI dev teams. The weird part: we've been using it to build itself — 387 autonomous cycles, 42 PRs merged by agents, 1,094 tests, 193 docs — all by AI agents.

The agents have:
- Cognitive memory with semantic search (Generative Agents-style)
- Role rotation with playbooks (10 specialized roles)
- Reflexion for learning from past actions

We just shipped v1.0-alpha.

Not asking for coverage — just thought you'd find it interesting given your work on [relevant topic].

Repo: github.com/ishan190425/autonomous-dev-agents

— Ishan, ADA
```

### Tier 2 Template (Brief)

```
Subject: Open-source AI dev teams

Hi [Name],

Quick one — we just shipped ADA, an open-source CLI for autonomous AI dev teams.

What's different: we built it using itself (387 cycles, 42 PRs, zero human commits). Multi-agent coordination with cognitive memory.

GitHub: github.com/ishan190425/autonomous-dev-agents

Thought it might be relevant to [their interest area].

— Ishan
```

### Newsletter Pitch Template

```
Subject: Show to readers? Autonomous AI Dev Teams

Hi [Editor],

Launching today: ADA — open-source CLI for autonomous AI dev teams.

The hook: We built it using itself. 387 autonomous cycles, 42 PRs merged, 1,094 tests, 193 docs — all by AI agents.

- Multi-role coordination (10 roles: CEO, Engineering, QA, etc.)
- Cognitive memory with semantic search
- CLI-first, TypeScript, open source

GitHub: github.com/ishan190425/autonomous-dev-agents
npm: @ada/cli

Available for questions if you'd like more context.

| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lilian Weng**      | "Your 'LLM Powered Autonomous Agents' post was foundational for our memory architecture. We implemented generative agents-style memory with salience" |
| **Simon Willison**   | "Love your deep-dives on AI tooling. sqlite-vec work is fascinating — we use similar embeddings for cognitive memory"                                 |
| **Jeremy Howard**    | "fast.ai's 'practical AI' ethos resonates. ADA is about democratizing autonomous dev teams, not just copilots"                                        |
| **Harrison Chase**   | "Different philosophy than LangChain — we're all-in on memory and role-based coordination vs. chain composition"                                      |
| **Guillermo Rauch**  | "Ship software with autonomous AI teams" — felt like a natural extension of Vercel's 'ship fast' ethos"                                               |
| **Theo Browne**      | "Know you'll call out BS if we deserve it. Built by 387 autonomous cycles — no human commits. Judge for yourself"                                     |
| **ThePrimeagen**     | "CLI-first, TypeScript strict mode, no magic. Built for devs who live in the terminal"                                                                |
| **Swyx**             | "For Latent Space: multi-agent coordination research turned into a real CLI. Reflexion, cognitive memory, 10-role dispatch"                           |
| **Cassidy Williams** | "Developer productivity angle — what if your repo had a resident AI team, not just a copilot?"                                                        |
| **Matt Shumer**      | "Know you're building competing tools. Sharing out of respect — different approach worth comparing"                                                   |

4. **Include proof** — Metrics, repo link, demo GIF
5. **One follow-up max** — If no response after 1 week, move on
6. **Celebrate any pickup** — RT, thank publicly, engage genuinely
7. **Handle criticism gracefully** — "Great point, we're working on that"
