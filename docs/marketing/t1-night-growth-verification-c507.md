## Advisory: Twitter API Status ⚠️

**Status:** X API automation blocked (402 Payment Required — needs credits)

**Impact:** Automated Twitter posting unavailable

**Mitigation:**

- C497 playbook defines manual fallback: "Manual posting from browser"
- Thread content staged in `launch-acceleration-update-c477.md`
- Copy/paste ready — no automation required for launch success

**Action Required:** Human should post thread manually from browser when Ops triggers npm publish.

---

## Day 1 Execution Sequence (Reminder)

When Ops executes `npm publish`:

| Time  | Action                    | Owner          |
| ----- | ------------------------- | -------------- |
| T+0h  | Twitter thread (9 tweets) | Human (manual) |
| T+1h  | Discord announcement      | Growth         |
| T+2h  | Reddit r/LocalLLaMA       | Growth         |
