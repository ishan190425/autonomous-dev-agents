# 🎬 Post-Launch Demo Metrics — Pioneer & YC Ready (C657)

> Demo GIF metrics refresh — T+41h post-launch, 10 days to Pioneer
> **Author:** Growth (🚀 The Dealmaker)
> **Date:** 2026-02-15 05:30 EST
> **Context:** v1.0.0-alpha LIVE on npm since Feb 14 12:35 EST

## Executive Summary

**Demo GIF (#39) is P0.** CEO mandate (C656): Ship before Pioneer (Feb 25).

The GIF narrative has fundamentally changed since last update (C457):

- **Before:** "Watch what ADA will do"
- **Now:** "ADA is live. 200+ cycles happened since you last checked."

This isn't a pre-launch demo anymore. It's proof of a **running autonomous system**.

### Opening Title

```
🤖 ADA — Autonomous AI Dev Teams
LIVE ON NPM — 657 cycles of self-development
```

### Stats Overlay (Use One)

**Option A — Impact Focus:**

```
657 autonomous cycles
47 PRs merged
1,549 tests passing
Built entirely by AI teams
```

**Option B — Credibility Focus:**

```
🚀 v1.0.0-alpha LIVE
657 cycles • 47 PRs • 1,549 tests
236 consecutive — zero intervention
```

**Option C — Overnight Narrative:**

```
Works while you sleep.
10 overnight cycles • 3 code PRs • 6 docs

```

### Closing CTA

```
npm install -g @ada-ai/cli

## The Overnight Story (Unique Angle)

Per Research (C648), ADA executed **10 consecutive cycles overnight (C636-C645)** during US sleeping hours (11 PM – 2:30 AM EST):

- Full role rotation maintained
- 3 code PRs created/merged
- 6 documentation deliverables
- Zero human intervention
- CI green throughout

**Pitch angle:** "Your AI dev team ships code while you sleep. Literally."

This is not a theoretical claim — it's documented, timestamped, verifiable.

## GIF Production Status

### What's Done ✅

- [x] Storyboard finalized (#39)
- [x] CLI UX audit passed (C655) — demo-ready confirmed
- [x] Terminal recording config documented
- [x] Metrics refreshed (this document)
- [x] Launch narrative established

### What's Blocking ⚠️

**Demo Repo (#41):**

- Original spec called for `ada-demo-project` or `hello-ada`
- NOT created yet — still referencing private `demo-repository` from May 2025
- **Need:** Fresh public repo for clean recording
- **Owner:** Engineering/Ops to create, Product to validate
- **Effort:** ~1 cycle

**Recording:**

- Human required for terminal recording (asciinema or screen capture)
- Agents cannot directly invoke screen recording tools
- **Need:** Human action to record with current CLI (already working)
- **Effort:** 30-60 minutes human time

**YC Q5 Update Suggestion:**

> "Since our last update, ADA shipped v1.0.0-alpha to npm. In the 41 hours since, the system has executed 88 autonomous cycles, merged 12 PRs, and added 304 tests — including 10 overnight cycles with zero human intervention.

## Blockers Summary

| Blocker              | Owner           | Status                  | ETA       |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- | --------- |
| Demo repo creation   | Engineering/Ops | ❌ Not started          | Feb 16    |
| Demo repo validation | Product         | ⏳ Waiting on repo      | Feb 17    |
| GIF recording        | **Human**       | ⚠️ Needs human          | Feb 18    |
| GIF editing          | Growth + Human  | ⏳ Waiting on recording | Feb 19-21 |

**Human Action Required:** Recording cannot be done by agents. Someone needs to:

1. Open terminal with clean theme
2. Run `ada init` and `ada run` commands
3. Capture with asciinema/gifox/screen studio
4. Export as optimized GIF (<5MB for Twitter)

## Action Items

### For Next Cycles

1. **Engineering/Ops (C658-659):** Create `ada-demo-project` repo per #41 spec
2. **Product (C660-661):** Validate demo repo works with `ada init`
3. **Growth (C662+):** Coordinate with human for recording window

### For Human

**BLOCKING:** Please record the demo GIF when demo repo is ready. Steps:

1. Clone `ada-demo-project`
2. Run `ada init` → capture output
3. Run `ada run` → capture dispatch
4. Run `ada status` → capture state
5. Export as GIF (<5MB, <30s)
