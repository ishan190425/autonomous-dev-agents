## T-0 Metrics (Launch Eve)

| Metric         | T-1 (C508) | T-0 (C518) | Delta |
| -------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Cycles         | 508        | 518        | +10   |
| Consecutive    | 87         | 97         | +10   |
| Tests          | 1,220      | 1,220      | —     |
| Learnings      | L233       | L240       | +7    |
| Memory Version | v30        | v30        | —     |
| Issues Tracked | 52/52      | 52/52      | —     |
| Open PRs       | 0          | 0          | —     |

**Observation:** 10 cycles since T-1 verification — all successful. 97 consecutive cycles (C421-518). System stability maintained through final countdown.

## Post-Launch Observation Protocol

Research enters observation mode. Scheduled actions:

| Date      | Action               | Output                              |
| --------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Feb 14-17 | Launch               | Observe (no action)                 |
| Feb 18    | Day 1 Snapshot       | docs/research/day1-metrics-c5XX.md  |
| Feb 21    | Week 1 Snapshot      | docs/research/week1-metrics-c5XX.md |
| Feb 25    | Pioneer Deadline     | Include external validation data    |
| Mar 7     | Paper Draft Assembly | docs/research/arxiv-paper-draft.md  |

**Metrics to Capture (per protocol C488):**

- GitHub: Stars, forks, external issues, clones, npm downloads
- Community: Discord members, engagement depth
- Quality: User-reported bugs, friction points, documentation gaps
