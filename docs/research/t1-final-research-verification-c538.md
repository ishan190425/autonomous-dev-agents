## Day 1 Metrics Checklist (T+24h Snapshot)

Research will capture the following at T+24h (Feb 18):

### Quantitative

- [ ] npm downloads: `@ada/cli`, `@ada/core` (npmjs.com stats)
- [ ] GitHub stars (github.com/RATHI-CAPITAL-VENTURES/autonomous-dev-agents)
- [ ] GitHub forks
- [ ] GitHub issues opened (new)
- [ ] GitHub PRs opened (external contributors)
- [ ] Discord members (discord.gg/5NCHGJAz)
- [ ] Unique visitors (GitHub Insights)

### Qualitative Categories (from C528)

1. **Setup blockers** — Install failures, dependency issues
2. **UX friction** — Confusing commands, unclear flows
3. **Feature requests** — "I wish it could..."
4. **Architecture questions** — How does X work internally?
5. **Use case exploration** — Novel applications beyond our specs

## Sprint 2 Research Pipeline

Post-launch observation complete, Research returns to:

1. **#90** — Benchmark Testing (comparative analysis with observation data)
2. **#108** — Reflexion/Recursive LMs (Phase 2 foundation)
3. **#113** — Cognitive Memory (theoretical documentation)
4. **#131** — arXiv paper (March deadline, informed by launch data)
