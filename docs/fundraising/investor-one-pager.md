# 🚀 ADA Investor One-Pager

> **Autonomous Dev Agent Teams for Any Repo**
> Pre-Seed Fundraising | $500K-$2M | February 2026

## The Problem

AI coding tools are **copilots**, not **teams**. Developers still orchestrate everything manually:

- GitHub Copilot writes code snippets → human reviews, tests, deploys
- Cursor helps with files → human manages issues, PRs, releases
- No tool handles the **full development lifecycle** autonomously

**Result:** 80% of developer time is still project management, not coding.

---

## The Solution

**ADA = Autonomous AI dev agent teams that replace manual coordination**

```bash
# One command creates a complete dev team in any repo
ada init
# Team automatically handles issues → code → tests → PRs → releases
ada run
```

- **Multi-role agents:** Product, Engineering, QA, DevOps working together
- **Full lifecycle:** From GitHub issues to deployed features
- **Any repo:** Drop into existing projects, not just greenfield
- **Template marketplace:** Pre-built team configurations for different use cases

## Market Opportunity

| Segment                               | Size   | ADA Addressable      |
| ------------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------- |
| **TAM** - Global software development | $100B+ | Full market          |
| **SAM** - Teams using AI dev tools    | $8B+   | Multi-agent adopters |
| **SOM** - Early adopter developers    | $800M  | 50K developers → 1M+ |

**Timing is perfect:**

- LLM capabilities crossed production threshold (2024-2025)
- Developers frustrated with "copilot fatigue" — want full automation
- Competition is single-agent tools (Devin, Cursor) — multi-agent is wide open

---

## Traction & Proof Points

✅ **Dogfooding success:** ADA built by ADA (27 autonomous cycles, 2500+ lines)
✅ **Real customer:** Social Trade app running ADA agents in production
✅ **Technical validation:** Built on Clawdbot platform, proven architecture
✅ **Market research:** Comprehensive competitive analysis, validated positioning

**User journey validated:** `init` → customize team → `run` → autonomous development

## Business Model

| Phase       | Product         | Revenue   | Target              |
| ----------- | --------------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| **Phase 1** | Open-source CLI | $0        | Developer adoption  |
| **Phase 2** | SaaS Dashboard  | $29-99/mo | Growing teams       |
| **Phase 3** | Enterprise      | $500+/mo  | Large organizations |

**Unit economics:** Low marginal cost (LLM API), high switching costs (team configuration), recurring revenue model.

## Competitive Advantage

| Competitor         | Approach              | Limitation                  |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Devin**          | Single super-agent    | No team specialization      |
| **Cursor**         | IDE assistant         | Manual orchestration        |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Code completion       | No project management       |
| **ADA**            | **Multi-agent teams** | **Full lifecycle autonomy** |

**Defensibility:** Network effects (template marketplace), data moat (successful team patterns), developer habit formation.

## Team & Execution

**Founder:** Technical background, AI/automation expertise, shipping experience
**Development:** Proven with autonomous agent success (dogfooding)
**Go-to-market:** Developer-first, open-source → SaaS playbook
**Scalability:** Built on proven infrastructure (Clawdbot), template-driven growth

---

## The Ask

**$500K - $2M Pre-Seed**

**Use of funds:**

- 40% → Engineering team (2-3 developers)
- 30% → Growth & community building
- 20% → Infrastructure & LLM costs
- 10% → Operations & legal

**Milestones:**

- Month 6: 1K CLI users, SaaS dashboard beta
- Month 12: 10K users, $50K ARR, Series A ready
- Month 24: 100K users, $1M+ ARR, market leader

---

## Why Now?

1. **LLM capability ceiling reached** → Multi-agent orchestration is the next frontier
2. **Developer productivity crisis** → Teams spending 80% time on coordination
3. **Open source timing** → Developer adoption accelerates with free CLI
4. **Competition gap** → Single-agent solutions leave multi-team opportunity wide open

**This is the shift from "AI helps developers" to "AI replaces development busywork"**

---
