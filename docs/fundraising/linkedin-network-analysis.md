## Message Templates

### To 1st Degree Connections

```
Hey [Name],

Hope you're doing well! I'm raising a pre-seed round for ADA, the autonomous dev agent platform I've been working on.

We're targeting [specific fund] because [specific reason related to their focus/portfolio]. I saw you're connected to [specific investor] and wondering if you'd be comfortable making an introduction?

Happy to share more context - we've got solid traction with the product (built by its own agents!) and a clear path to market.

Would love to catch up regardless of fundraising!

Best,
[Founder]
```

### To Portfolio Company Founders

```
Hi [Name],

I'm [Founder], building ADA - autonomous AI dev agent teams. We're raising pre-seed and I'd love to connect with [investor] at [fund] who backed [their company].

We're in the dev productivity space (but multi-agent approach vs single copilots) and I think [specific portfolio overlap reason] makes [fund] a great fit.

Any chance you'd be open to a brief intro? Happy to share our one-pager and keep it low-pressure.

Thanks!
[Founder]
```
