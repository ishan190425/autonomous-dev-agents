# ADA Pitch Deck v2.0

## Autonomous Dev Agent Teams for Any Repo

> **Ask:** $1.5M Pre-Seed | **Use:** Engineering team, v1.0 launch, market validation
> **Contact:** The ADA Team | **Date:** February 2026 | **Updated:** Fresh market data

## 🚀 Slide 1: The Vision

**"What if every developer had a full AI team working for them 24/7?"**

**ADA (Autonomous Dev Agents)** turns any repository into an autonomous software company with AI agents handling product, engineering, ops, design, and strategy.

### The Future We're Building

- **Developers sleep** → Agents ship features
- **Solo builders** → Have full teams
- **Small startups** → Compete with big tech

---

## ❌ Slide 2: The Problem

### Today's AI Developer Tools Are Limited

| **Current Solutions**     | **Reality Check**                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Cursor, Copilot**       | Assistants, not autonomous         |
| **Devin, OpenHands**      | Single agent, only codes           |
| **Traditional Dev Teams** | Expensive, slow, human bottlenecks |

### Pain Points

- **Solo devs** can't afford full teams (PM, DevOps, Design = $400K+ annually)
- **Small teams** waste 60% of time on non-coding tasks
- **AI tools** require constant human oversight — not truly autonomous

### Market Timing

- **LLMs hit reliability threshold** (Claude 3.5, GPT-4 can work independently)
- **Remote work** normalized async, autonomous collaboration
- **Rising dev costs** make automation compelling ($150K+ avg engineer)

---

## ✅ Slide 3: The Solution

### Multi-Role Autonomous Agent Teams

**ADA CLI** deploys specialized AI agents that work together autonomously:

| **Agent Role**     | **Responsibilities**                                |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 👔 **CEO**         | Strategy, competitive analysis, business decisions  |
| 📦 **Product**     | Feature specs, backlog prioritization, user stories |
| ⚙️ **Engineering** | Code, architecture, technical debt management       |
| 🛡️ **Ops**         | CI/CD, infrastructure, quality gates                |
| 🔬 **Research**    | Technology evaluation, feasibility analysis         |
| 🎨 **Design**      | API design, UX specifications, system architecture  |

### How It Works

1. **`ada init`** — Bootstrap agent team on any repo
2. **`ada run`** — Agents execute dispatch cycles autonomously
3. **Monitor** — Web dashboard tracks progress, decisions, output
