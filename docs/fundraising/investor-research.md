## Competitive Positioning

### vs. Devin (Cognition)

| Aspect   | Devin                       | ADA                                        |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Approach | Single agent, full autonomy | Multi-agent team, specialized roles        |
| Target   | Replace junior devs         | Augment entire team                        |
| Memory   | Session-based               | Persistent cognitive memory                |
| Pricing  | $500/month                  | Freemium (Pro TBD)                         |
| Proof    | Demo videos                 | **Self-dogfooding (617 cycles) + SHIPPED** |
| Status   | Closed beta                 | **npm LIVE TODAY**                         |

**Pitch:** "Devin is a single AI employee. ADA is an AI department. And we've shipped."

### vs. GitHub Copilot

| Aspect | Copilot          | ADA                |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Mode   | Autocomplete     | Autonomous         |
| Scope  | Code suggestions | Full dev lifecycle |
| Agent  | Single           | Multi-role team    |
| Memory | None             | Persistent bank    |

**Pitch:** "Copilot helps you write code. ADA helps you ship products."

### vs. CrewAI/AutoGen

| Aspect     | CrewAI/AutoGen | ADA                                   |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Focus      | General agents | Dev teams specifically                |
| Memory     | Basic/none     | Cognitive architecture                |
| Governance | Manual         | Self-enforcing rules                  |
| Proof      | Examples       | **Self-built framework, LIVE on npm** |

**Pitch:** "We didn't just build an agent framework. We built a team that builds itself. And shipped it."

---

## Objection Handling

### "How is this different from Devin?"

> "Devin is a single agent trying to do everything. ADA is specialized roles working together — CEO, Engineer, QA, Product, etc. — like a real dev team. Different approach, different market. We think teams, not individuals, are the right abstraction. And we've shipped — try it: `npm i -g @ada-ai/cli`"

### "Why will developers trust autonomous agents?"

> "They shouldn't blindly trust — that's why we have governance. Self-enforcing rules, mandatory code review by QA role, human-in-the-loop for external actions. Trust is earned through transparency and constraints. Our 196 consecutive cycles with zero intervention proves it works."

### "What's the moat?"

> "Three things: (1) **617 cycles of self-improvement data** — our memory bank is trained on real autonomous development. (2) **Cognitive memory architecture** — we're implementing Generative Agents-style memory that compounds over time. (3) **Self-dogfooding** — we're the only framework that built itself AND shipped. That's irreplicable."

### "Solo founder risk?"

> "My AI team has 10 roles running 24/7. I'm not solo — I have 10 tireless teammates. And we're raising to add human engineers. The AI team de-risks the solo founder problem."

### "You haven't launched yet?"

> "**We launched Feb 14, 2026.** v1.0.0-alpha is live on npm. Real users can install it today. We're not pitching vaporware — we're pitching a shipped product that built itself."

## Outreach Templates (Updated for SHIPPED Status)

### Cold Email Template (VC)

```
Subject: ADA — The AI framework that built itself (617 cycles, SHIPPED)

Hi [Name],

[Personalized hook based on their thesis/portfolio]

I'm building ADA — autonomous AI dev teams for any repo. The unique part: we've been dogfooding it for 600+ cycles. The AI team merged 43 PRs, wrote 1,360 tests, and created 339 pages of docs.

And it shipped itself. v1.0-alpha is live on npm: `npm i -g @ada-ai/cli`

We launched Feb 14 and raising a $500K-$2M pre-seed.

Would love 15 minutes to show you how multi-agent coordination beats single-agent coding.

Demo: [link]
npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ada-ai/cli
Deck: [link]

```

### Angel Intro Template

```
Subject: Solo founder with 10 AI teammates — we shipped today

Hey [Name],

You tweeted about [specific AI topic]. Thought you'd appreciate this:

I built ADA — multi-role AI dev teams. The wild part? The AI team built the framework. 617 autonomous cycles, zero human code.

And it shipped itself — live on npm today: `npm i -g @ada-ai/cli`

Raising $500K-$2M. Looking for angels who get frontier AI.

Try it: npm i -g @ada-ai/cli
